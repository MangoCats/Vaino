## Recommendations

### For WKMP Musical Flavor Matching

1. **Fallback Strategy Required:**
   - 8.9% of recordings lack AcousticBrainz data
   - Implement fallback to local Essentia analysis for missing recordings
   - Consider caching Essentia results to avoid re-analysis

2. **Prioritize Caching:**
   - 91.1% coverage is excellent for cache seeding
   - Query AcousticBrainz first during import
   - Fall back to local analysis only when necessary

3. **User Communication:**
   - Inform users which tracks have AcousticBrainz data vs. local analysis
   - May affect musical flavor matching accuracy for missing recordings

4. **Genre-Specific Handling:**
   - Live albums: Expect lower coverage, rely more on local analysis
   - Soundtracks: Variable coverage
   - Pre-2000 mainstream: Excellent coverage (95%+)
   - Post-2012 releases: Reduced coverage
