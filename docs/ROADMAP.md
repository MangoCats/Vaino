# ROADMAP: What's Open, Across the Project

**Orientation — Tier 1 · forward-looking only, added 2026-09-03 per `[GOV-DOC-050]`**

A single scan point for "what's not built yet." Most open items live in the
document whose subject they belong to — this page mostly **links** rather than
duplicates, so a change to one of those sections doesn't also require an edit
here. The prose sections below hold only the material that doesn't belong to
a single document: cross-cutting plans, or an investigation that was never
folded into one spec.

> **Related:** [architecture.md](architecture.md) for what's built ·
> [GOV001](GOV001-document-hygiene.md) `[GOV-DOC-050]` for the convention this
> page exists to satisfy · [GUIDE001](GUIDE001-lineage-and-lessons.md) for the
> historical counterpart to this page

## 2. Sendspin — a whole directory of "watch, don't build yet"

[`sendspin/`](../sendspin/) holds six investigation documents (SPIN001–006)
into whether/how Vaino should interoperate with the Sendspin multi-room
ecosystem, Music Assistant, and OpenSubsonic. Every one of them is already
structured as current analysis plus its own small "Open"/"Recommendation"
section — nothing here is built, and the standing recommendation across all
six is to watch rather than commit engineering time. Read
[SPIN001](../sendspin/SPIN001-protocol-and-integration-analysis.md) first;
each of the other five narrows to one sub-question it raised.

## 3. Rearchitecture — what's still ahead

*(From [GUIDE002](GUIDE002-rearchitecture-plan.md)'s phased plan and open
questions — see [GUIDE001 §8](GUIDE001-lineage-and-lessons.md#8-rearchitecture-phases--retrospective)
for the phases that have already shipped.)*

### P4 — Ingest & DAO Segmentation

Requirements (`[REQ-LIB-200..215]`) and specification
([SPEC024](spec/SPEC024-dao-segmentation-cascade.md)) are done; the four
reproducible cascade stages (grid search, DP assembly, RMS quiet-spot
fallback, extra-track merging) are built — see
[GUIDE001 §8](GUIDE001-lineage-and-lessons.md#8-rearchitecture-phases--retrospective)
for what shipped. Two pieces remain genuinely open, both detailed in
[SPEC024 §8](spec/SPEC024-dao-segmentation-cascade.md#8-open):

1. **The 7-strategy automatic MusicBrainz edition search** that would
   supply the cascade's expected track count/durations without a human
   typing them in — real query design, rate-limited network calls, and
   its own accuracy measurement, genuinely separate work from the cascade
   itself.
2. **McRhythm's "Stage 6" boundary refinement** — no recoverable
   algorithm survives to reproduce, only tuning thresholds and aggregate
   results in a historical test-results document. A future pass would be
   new design work informed by those numbers, not a port.

**Independent re-verification against Vaino's own library — partial.**
`[GOV-SRC-020]`: no CI-portable ground-truth corpus exists in this repo —
`segment_dao.py --validate` checks against the user's own live `vaino.db`
(188 files / 2,676 boundaries). A 40-file sample, run 2026-09-03: 40/40
exact track count (100%), 94% of boundary starts within 2s, all resolved
by Stage 2 alone — see [SPEC024](spec/SPEC024-dao-segmentation-cascade.md)'s
own status banner. The full 188-file population, and a real case that
actually exercises DP assembly/the RMS fallback/merging rather than only
their synthetic unit tests, remain unrun.

### Open questions

1. **Which user-defined characteristics to define first?** `[GDE-ARC-030]` supports them generally; MuLibPlay's six years of use suggest christmas / winter / summer / kids are the proven ones `[GDE-PD-020]`.
2. **Wall Art / Kiosk display mode — dropped, or merely unrevisited?** The pre-rearchitecture plan (`docs/user-interface.md`, now deleted) specified a fullscreen wall-tablet mode: large album art, clock, upcoming-track cards, OLED/LCD burn-in protection. Grep for `wall.art|kiosk|burn.in` across `player/` and `tools/` returns nothing — it was never built, and the current skin model (`vaino`/`mulibplay`/`winamp`, all document-shaped, `[REQ-VIS-160]`) has no kiosk-style skin among them. Nothing in `REQ002` accepts or rejects it. If wanted, it is a fourth skin under the existing contract; if not, this line is where that should be said.
3. **The Phase 7 feature list — dropped, or merely unrevisited?** The old roadmap's final phase (`docs/roadmap.md`, now deleted) named station-ID/jingle injection between tracks, news/weather TTS announcements, and MQTT/smart-home hooks. None appear in `REQ002` or any current `SPEC`, and none exist in code. This is *not* the same question as scrobbling — `[SPEC-MPD-100]` already, deliberately, declines that one for the MPD guest path specifically, reasoning that guest clients already scrobble. The other three were simply never revisited after the rearchitecture and carry no decision either way.
4. **Library-browse pagination — was the REQ001-era page-size selector dropped on purpose?** The deleted `REQ001`'s `[REQ-UI-020K]` specified a page-size dropdown (`10`/`25`/`50`/`100`/`250`) with dynamic Prev/Next controls. The built `/browse` route (`player/src/web/browse.rs`, split out of `web.rs` 2026-09-02) instead caps every response at a flat 2,000 rows with no selector `[REQ-VIS-180]`. That may be the right call for a LAN player with a "Built for a phone" design brief — a flat cap is simpler and 2,000 rows is generous — but it was never stated as a deliberate simplification, only as an absence.

## 4. The appliance's still-open speaker questions

**Does a reopened Bluetooth output stream actually hold indefinitely, or does
the 700 ms settle merely push the failure further out?** Investigated
2026-08-16 in [PI003 §4a](../VainoPi/PI003-choosing-a-speaker.md#4a-the-reopened-stream-and-feeding-silence-while-paused);
the incident and what was tried is recorded in
[PI008 §2](../VainoPi/PI008-appliance-bringup-history.md#2-a-reopened-stream-dies-a-fresh-one-does-not).

A stream rebuilt against an already-running player (`recover()`) was found to
lose the speaker about twenty-two seconds after reopening, every time, while a
stream opened fresh at startup held indefinitely. Giving PipeWire 700 ms to
finish tearing down the old stream before opening the new one closed the gap
in testing — two minutes, connected on every sample, from the worst case
(player already running, no speaker, then connect and select).

That two-minute result is not enough to trust on its own: an earlier
two-minute test had already been called "verified" once, and the drop
actually arrived twenty seconds after that window closed, at about two and a
half minutes. No test run so far has gone longer than the failure interval it
was trying to rule out. **Still open:** whether the 700 ms settle actually
fixes the fragility, or only delays it past whatever window each test
happened to run, is unconfirmed. Closing this needs a run of at least ten
minutes with the underrun counter watched throughout — the signal that
caught the fault both previous times it mattered — before the reopened-
stream path can be called reliable rather than merely improved.

**Traceability:** exists to satisfy `[GOV-DOC-050]` · nothing here is a
requirement or a spec in its own right — every open item traces back to the
`REQ`/`SPEC`/`GDE` tag in the document it's linked from.
