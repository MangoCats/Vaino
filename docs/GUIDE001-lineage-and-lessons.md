# GUIDE001: Project Lineage & Lessons Learned

**Development Guidance — Tier 0**

Captures the measured state of the three predecessor systems (MuLibPlay, McRhythm/wkmp, Vaino v1) as of **2026-08-08**, and the evidence-backed lessons that constrain the Vaino re-implementation. Companion document: [GUIDE002: Re-Architecture Plan](GUIDE002-rearchitecture-plan.md).

> Every claim below is sourced from live inspection of the running deployment, the three repositories, and their databases. Measurements, not impressions.

## 1. The Lineage

| System | Language / Shape | Status | What it is |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MuLibPlay** | Qt5 C++, single process | **Live** on `pi@bose.lan` since 2020 | The working benchmark. Everything must equal or beat it. |
| **McRhythm / wkmp** | Rust, 6 microservices, ~100K LOC | Stalled Feb 2026 | Ambitious re-imagining. Solved DAO segmentation; drowned in scope. |
| **Vaino v1** | Python/FastAPI + partial Go port | Current repo | Quick stab at a simpler McRhythm. Plays audio; accuracy and latency are unacceptable. |

---

## 2. MuLibPlay — The Benchmark (what "good" means)

**`[GDE-BMK-010]` Live deployment measurements** (`pi@bose.lan`, Raspberry Pi 4, armv7l, 1884 MB RAM, kernel 5.15):

- Process RSS **171 MB**, 15.2% CPU, HTTP control UI on port 1160.
- Library: **44 GB / 7,238 files**, largest single file **340 MB / 244.9 minutes** (`GoodbyeYellowBrickRoad.mp3`).
- 6 years of continuous operation. Play history spans **2020-03-26 → present, 37,134 events**.

**`[GDE-BMK-020]` Database content** (`mulib.db`, 95 MB):

| Entity | Count | Note |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| tracks | 8,116 | |
| cuts | 16,232 | Exactly 2 per track — see `[GDE-BMK-030]` |
| files | 5,615 | 189 are true DAO files (>1 distinct track) |
| albums / artists | 675 / 470 | |
| playHistory | 37,134 | |
| AcousticBrainz vectors | 8,062 (99.3%) | Downloaded before shutdown. **Irreplaceable.** |
| rotation/recovery/restraint set | ~2,918 (36%) | Hand-tuned user preference |

Max tracks in one DAO file: **40** (`Purple.mp3`, `WhatsTheStoryMorningGlory.mp3`).

**`[GDE-BMK-030]` The Album/Radio cut duality — the single best schema idea in the lineage.**
Every track carries two `cuts` rows against the same file:
- **`Album`** — full boundaries, `gain = 1.0`, segue points equal to the hard boundaries.
- **`Radio`** — trimmed boundaries, distinct `startSegueFrame`/`endSegueFrame`, computed `gain` (~0.70–0.75 observed) for loudness matching.

The Program Director selects **only `Radio` cuts**. One recording, multiple presentations, one file. Vaino v1 discarded this; it must come back.

*(Vaino's own realization is `passages.kind IN ('album','radio')` — same duality, current terms and semantics in [SPEC008 §3](spec/SPEC008-database-schema.md#3-passages--the-albumradio-duality) and [SPEC023](spec/SPEC023-domain-vocabulary.md).)*

**`[GDE-BMK-040]` Dead schema — do not port.** The following `tracks` columns have been NULL for all 8,116 rows across six years: `tempo`, `intensity`, `keyMood`, `darkLight`, `genre`, `themes`. `quality`, `jts`, `popularity` have ≤10 rows. They were aspirational and never used. Six years of production is conclusive evidence.

**`[GDE-BMK-050]` The confirmed weak spot — there is no ingest.** `MaintController::scanFile` (`maintController.cpp:380` (MuLibPlay source, not imported)) does exactly one thing: hash a file, `SELECT * FROM files WHERE sig = :hash`, and update `filePath` if it matches. It **relocates known files**. It cannot induct new music. MuLibPlay contains no MusicBrainz client, no fingerprinting, no segmentation. The entire new-music process is external manual labor — which is precisely why it is undocumented, unrepeatable, and easily forgotten.

---

## 3. MuLibPlay's Selection Algorithm — Preserve Exactly

Source: [musicdirector.cpp](inherited/mulibplay/musicdirector.cpp). This algorithm produces the good selections. It is the most valuable transferable asset in the lineage after the data itself.

**`[GDE-PD-010]` Log-scale time encoding.** `rotationValueToSeconds(rv) = 10^rv × 3600`. So `-1.0` → 6 min, `0.0` → 1 hour, `1.0` → 10 hours. One tunable float spans four orders of magnitude.

**`[GDE-PD-020]` Multiplicative eligibility weighting**, applied to artists first, then tracks:
1. Base weight `w = 10^(-restraint)`.
2. **Hard block** if `now - lastPlay < rotationSeconds`.
3. **Linear recovery ramp** otherwise: `w *= (age - rotSecs) / recSecs`, clamped to `[0, 1]`.
4. Track weight multiplies its artist's weight. Related tracks (`relatedTracks`) also block and damp, scaled by relation strength.
5. Seasonal `occasionWeight()` multiplier — `[C]`hristmas, `[W]`inter, `[S]`ummer, `[K]`ids.
6. Drop below `minWeightLimit = 0.001`.

**`[GDE-PD-030]` Cut-level filters and length bonus.** Radio cuts only; reject `< 30 s`, `> 3600 s`, or starting `> 10800 s` into a file. Then `w *= sqrt(min(4.0, 180s / cutLength))` — a mild preference for ~3-minute cuts, capped at 2.0× for short ones.

**`[GDE-PD-040]` Programs are defined by seed tracks, not by tuned curves.** Eight time-of-day programs, each a list of 6–8 exemplar track IDs:

| Time | Program | | Time | Program |
| :--- | :--- | :-- | :--- | :--- |
| 04:00 | Soft | | 15:00 | Groove |
| 10:00 | Light | | 16:30 | Fun |
| 12:00 | Cool | | 19:00 | Prog |
| 14:00 | Loud | | 22:00 | Mellow |

"What should 10 AM sound like?" is answered by naming six songs. This is dramatically more usable than tuning eleven sliders, and it should be kept.

**`[GDE-PD-050]` Two-stage acoustic shaping over the 11-D AcousticBrainz vector** (`danceable, female, acoustic, aggressive, happy, party, relaxed, sad, bright, tonal, instrumental`; plain squared Euclidean distance, unweighted):
1. **Prune** — down-select ≤5 seeds (one per artist, least-recently-played), then remove the tracks *most unlike* each seed until the pool reaches ~1,000.
2. **Gather** — take the ~100 tracks *most like* each seed.
3. **Flow** — re-sort that pool by similarity to the **last track already in the queue**, so consecutive songs blend.
4. **Roulette** — take the top 100, apply rank decay `simWt *= 0.96` per position, then weighted-random pick.

Randomness is applied *last*, over an already-shaped pool. The character comes from the shaping; the surprise comes from the roulette.

## 4. McRhythm / wkmp — What Worked, What Killed It

**`[GDE-MCR-010]` The DAO segmenter genuinely works.** Measured over a 200-album test ([STAGE6_FULL_TEST_RESULTS_20260109.md](inherited/mcrhythm/MCR-STAGE6_FULL_TEST_RESULTS_20260109.md)):

- **93.0%** album match rate (186/200); 7 genuine failures, 7 intentionally skipped.
- **96.0%** mean track-boundary match; **67.2%** of matched albums perfect (100%).
- Stage-6 RMS boundary refinement improved **114 of 186** albums with zero regressions.
- ~180× speedup by computing one windowed dB profile and filtering it 180 ways, instead of 180 audio scans. 87.6% of albums early-exit at a median of 4 parameter combinations tried out of 180.

Architecture: a cascade — parameter grid search → dynamic-programming assembly (over-segmented) → RMS quiet-spot (vinyl/cassette) → extra merging (bonus tracks) — plus a 7-strategy MusicBrainz edition search (CamelCase splitting, fuzzy edit distance, per-token fuzzy, album-only fallback). **This is the fix for MuLibPlay's weak spot and it already exists.**

**`[GDE-MCR-020]` The audio player design is correct.** [SPEC016](inherited/mcrhythm/MCR-SPEC016-decoder_buffer_design.md): per-passage `decoder → resampler → fader → ring buffer` chains, ~15 s buffered per passage (**5.3 MB** at 44.1 kHz stereo f32), mixer draining into an output ring buffer, target **≤150 MB total RSS** on a 512 MB Pi Zero 2W. Streaming, bounded, never whole-file.

**`[GDE-MCR-030]` What killed it: scope multiplied by six.** From the project's own [TECHNICAL_DEBT_ANALYSIS.md](inherited/mcrhythm/MCR-TECHNICAL_DEBT_ANALYSIS.md):
- Six microservices (`ap`, `ui`, `pd`, `ai`, `le`, `dr`) each with its own HTTP server, all against one SQLite file.
- The ingest service alone reached **71,321 lines of Rust**.
- **Two complete parallel extractor hierarchies** (`src/extractors/` and `src/fusion/extractors/`) — flagged CRITICAL by the project's own analysis.
- Three coexisting pipeline generations (legacy, PLAN024, PLAN025) in the same tree.
- 2,253-line orchestrator; 141 gratuitous `clone()` calls; 26 files with no tests.

The technology was fine. The surface area was not. A 6-service split for a single-user appliance bought nothing and cost everything.

**`[GDE-MCR-040]` AcousticBrainz shutdown is the unsolved blocker.** With the service gone, descriptors for new music must be computed locally. Neither McRhythm nor Vaino v1 ever landed a validated local extractor. **This is the true critical-path problem of the whole lineage** — see [GUIDE003](GUIDE003-feature-extraction-strategy.md).

**`[GDE-MCR-045]` The live API died between January and August 2026 — measured.** McRhythm successfully queried `acousticbrainz.org` on **2026-01-01**, retrieving data for 2,427 of 2,664 recordings (91.1% coverage) ([acousticbrainz_coverage_report.md](inherited/mcrhythm/MCR-acousticbrainz_coverage_report.md)). Retested **2026-08-08**: every request returns HTTP 500 or times out. That window has closed.

**The 2022-06-23 archival dumps are still served** from `data.metabrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/acousticbrainz/dumps/` — `highlevel-json` and `lowlevel-json`, roughly 30 shards of 1–2 GB each. Given that the API died without notice, these should be treated as **also at risk and mirrored promptly**.

**`[GDE-MCR-050]` McRhythm's functional requirements are the most refined in the lineage — inherit them.** Unlike Vaino v1's specifications (written quickly, largely uncontested), McRhythm's received sustained investment and revision:

| Document | Lines | Contributes |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| [REQ001-requirements.md](inherited/mcrhythm/MCR-REQ001-requirements.md) | 731 | 15 revision commits. Covers ground Vaino's 116-line REQ001 does not: queue-empty behaviour, play history, network status, user identity, offline operation, error handling, library edge cases, three build tiers |
| [REQ002-entity_definitions.md](inherited/mcrhythm/MCR-REQ002-entity_definitions.md) | 247 | Passage / Song / Recording / Work entity model |
| [SPEC003-musical_flavor.md](inherited/mcrhythm/MCR-SPEC003-musical_flavor.md) | 188 | See `[GDE-MCR-060]` |
| [SPEC005-program_director.md](inherited/mcrhythm/MCR-SPEC005-program_director.md) | 471 | Selection algorithm design |
| [SPEC004-musical_taste.md](inherited/mcrhythm/MCR-SPEC004-musical_taste.md) · [SPEC006-like_dislike.md](inherited/mcrhythm/MCR-SPEC006-like_dislike.md) | 203 | Taste model, Like/Dislike semantics |

For scale: McRhythm's REQ001 alone (731 lines) is more than a third the size of Vaino's entire `docs/` tree (2,049 lines).

**`[GDE-MCR-060]` Musical Flavor is a genuine advance over MuLibPlay's 11 numbers.** [SPEC003](inherited/mcrhythm/MCR-SPEC003-musical_flavor.md) defines flavor as the **full AcousticBrainz highlevel vector — 18 classifiers, 71 dimensions**, not the 11 scalars MuLibPlay stores:

- **Binary characteristics** (2 dims summing to 1.0): `danceability`, `gender`, `mood_*`, `timbre`, `tonal_atonal`, `voice_instrumental`.
- **Complex characteristics** (3+ dims summing to 1.0): `genre_dortmund` (9), `genre_tzanetakis` (10), `genre_rosamerica` (8), `genre_electronic` (5), `ismir04_rhythm` (10), `moods_mirex` (5). **None of these exist in `mulib.db`.**
- **User-defined characteristics** — e.g. `user.christmas.all.{christmasy, not_christmasy}`, `user.seasonal_affinity.all.{winter, spring, summer, fall}` — computed and treated identically to the built-in ones. This is a clean generalization of MuLibPlay's hardcoded `[C]`/`[W]`/`[S]`/`[K]` occasion hack `[GDE-PD-020]`, and it is a better idea.

Two deliberate, documented asymmetries worth preserving:
- **Flavor distance uses only *intersecting* characteristics** — never assume missing data is zero when comparing two specific items.
- **Taste uses the *union* centroid** — build the broadest possible profile when aggregating many items.

**`[GDE-MCR-070]` The Like/Dislike model is well thought through.** [SPEC006](inherited/mcrhythm/MCR-SPEC006-like_dislike.md): two centroids (Like-Taste and Dislike-Taste) producing two ranked lists, with the dislike list usable as an exclusion filter — "well-liked yet potentially unexpected". Click-stacking within a 5-minute window increases weight; the opposite button acts as undo; a detail panel exposes and permits direct editing of the resulting float weights. Passage-level actions are distributed across constituent songs. Note its own caveat: how Taste feeds the Program Director is explicitly *left undefined*.

## 5. Vaino v1 — Measured Failures

**`[GDE-V1-010]` The descriptors were inherited, not computed.** Direct comparison of `vaino.db` against `mulib.db`, joined on MusicBrainz recording ID (7,648 tracks matched):

| Descriptor | n | Pearson r | MAE |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ab_acoustic | 7,643 | 0.984 | 0.006 |
| ab_happy | 7,643 | 0.985 | 0.005 |
| ab_danceable | 7,643 | 0.981 | 0.007 |
| *(all 11 dimensions)* | 7,643 | **0.978 – 0.992** | **0.004 – 0.008** |

That is not agreement — that is **copying**. **7,481 of 8,215 rows (91%) are bit-identical** to MuLibPlay's values to within 1e-6. Only **292 rows (3.6%)** carry the ONNX extractor's signature (3-decimal rounding, `[0.02, 0.98]` clamp). The claim that Essentia/ONNX replaced AcousticBrainz was never tested at scale; the data looks excellent only because it was borrowed from its predecessor.

**`[GDE-V1-020]` The ONNX extractor is technically broken.** [src/audio/onnx_extractor.py](https://github.com/MangoCats/Vaino/blob/archive/v1-python-and-go-evaluation/src/audio/onnx_extractor.py), four independent defects, any one of which invalidates the output:

1. **Decimation is not resampling.** `samples[::int(sr/16000)]` gives `step = 2` for 44.1 kHz → **22,050 Hz**, then labels it 16,000 Hz. No anti-alias filter, so the result is aliased *and* time-scaled.
2. **A 3-second sample stands in for the whole track.** 187 frames × 256 hop ≈ 2.99 s, taken from the file's midpoint. AcousticBrainz aggregates over the entire recording.
3. **Wrong compression.** `log10(max(1e-5, magnitude))` on an unnormalized filterbank, where Essentia's `TensorflowInputMusiCNN` uses `log10(1 + 10000·x)` on normalized power mel. MusicNN receives out-of-distribution input.
4. **Discrimination discarded** by clamping to `[0.02, 0.98]` and rounding to 3 decimals.

**`[GDE-V1-030]` The lag has one cause: whole-file decode.** `AudioEngine._load_audio_file` calls `miniaudio.decode_file(file_path)` — the entire file into a NumPy array — while holding `self._lock`, from a synchronous FastAPI handler ([engine.py:226](https://github.com/MangoCats/Vaino/blob/archive/v1-python-and-go-evaluation/src/audio/engine.py)). Play/skip latency is therefore proportional to *whole-file* decode time.

For this library's largest file (244.9 min): **~2.6 GB** decoded at int16, **~5.2 GB** at float32. That is not slow on a Pi Zero 2W — it is impossible. Compare McRhythm's 5.3 MB streaming buffer `[GDE-MCR-020]`. **A ~1000× memory difference.**

**`[GDE-V1-040]` Schema regression.** A single flat `tracks` table with `start_offset_ms`/`end_offset_ms` replaced MuLibPlay's `files → cuts → tracks → artists/albums` model. Consequences: no Album/Radio duality `[GDE-BMK-030]`, no `files` entity, no content signature (so files cannot be relocated), `track_relations` **empty (0 rows)**, `musicbrainz_album_id` on only 2,448/8,216 (30%).

**`[GDE-V1-050]` Two half-implementations.** A Python implementation (4,472 lines) and an abandoned Go port (3,481 lines) of the same system coexist in one repo — the same duplication pattern that McRhythm flagged as CRITICAL `[GDE-MCR-030]`.

**`[GDE-V1-060]` What v1 got right — keep it.** `src/audio/selector.py` is a faithful, readable port of the MuLibPlay weighting math `[GDE-PD-010..030]`, including the log-scale rotation encoding and the seasonal occasion multipliers. WebSocket push already exists. These are worth carrying forward.

## 6. The Lessons, Distilled

| # | Lesson | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`[GDE-LES-010]`** | **Never decode a whole file.** Streaming, bounded per-passage buffers are non-negotiable. | `[GDE-V1-030]` vs `[GDE-MCR-020]` |
| **`[GDE-LES-020]`** | **No descriptor value without recorded provenance.** Inherited and computed values became indistinguishable and hid a total extraction failure for months. | `[GDE-V1-010]` |
| **`[GDE-LES-030]`** | **Every ML substitution is measured against ground truth, continuously and publicly.** Not a one-time ship/no-ship gate — a standing scorecard that drives iteration. 7,648 tracks with both real AcousticBrainz values and local audio already exist as a labeled set. | `[GDE-V1-010]`, `[GDE-MCR-040]` |
| **`[GDE-LES-040]`** | **One implementation per component.** Parallel hierarchies killed McRhythm and are already reappearing in Vaino v1. | `[GDE-MCR-030]`, `[GDE-V1-050]` |
| **`[GDE-LES-050]`** | **Split by runtime constraint, not by fashion.** Six microservices for a single-user appliance bought nothing. | `[GDE-MCR-030]` |
| **`[GDE-LES-060]`** | **Migrate the data; never re-derive it.** 6 years of play history, 8,062 real AcousticBrainz vectors, 16,232 verified cut boundaries, 2,918 tuned preferences. | `[GDE-BMK-020]` |
| **`[GDE-LES-070]`** | **Don't port aspirational schema.** Six years of NULLs is a decisive verdict. | `[GDE-BMK-040]` |
| **`[GDE-LES-080]`** | **Keep the exemplar-based preference model**, and generalize it via user-defined flavor characteristics. Naming six songs beats tuning eleven sliders. | `[GDE-PD-040]`, `[GDE-MCR-060]` |
| **`[GDE-LES-090]`** | **Inherit McRhythm's functional requirements, not its architecture.** The requirements were refined over many revisions; the 6-service structure is what failed. | `[GDE-MCR-050]`, `[GDE-MCR-030]` |
| **`[GDE-LES-100]`** | **External data sources vanish without notice.** AcousticBrainz's API died within seven months of a successful bulk query. Mirror what you depend on, now. | `[GDE-MCR-045]` |

## 7. Disposal Register

Per `[GDE-ARC-060]`, predecessors are retained only while they still teach. Each entry is deleted when its column empties.

**`[GDE-DIS-010]` Outstanding learning value:**

| Artifact | Still to be learned from it |
| :--- | :--- |
| `vaino.db` | 74,299 play-history rows (vs MuLibPlay's 37,134) — reconcile the surplus and establish which are genuine. The 2,279 DAO slice boundaries — compare against McRhythm's segmenter output as a test case. The 729 novel tracks — the P0 target population. |
| `src/audio/selector.py` | Reference cross-check for the P3 port `[GDE-V1-060]`. |
| `src/db/dao_slicer.py`, `resolver.py`, `acoustic_resolver.py` | Whether any identification heuristic here outperforms McRhythm's cascade. Probably not — verify, then discard. |
| `go/` (3,481 lines) | **Nothing.** Incomplete, duplicative `[GDE-V1-050]`. **Delete now.** |
| v1 `docs/spec/*`: `REQ001`, `SPEC001`, `SPEC002`, `SPEC003`, `SPEC004-rust-migration-guide.md` | **Historical, informational, and on the disposal path.** These are working-tree remnants of v1 thinking, not live specifications, and describe an architecture (single Python/FastAPI process, `≤30MB`/`<1s` boot, Essentia FFI-linked into the player) `[GDE-CHT-050]` rejected. *Correction 2026-08-30: this row previously named `docs/spec/SPEC004-go-migration-guide.md`, a file that has never existed in this tree — the real `SPEC004` is the Rust migration guide above, and `go/` never had a doc of its own to delete alongside it. `SPEC001` (audio-engine trait contracts / ramp math) was omitted from this row entirely; its ramp formulas are superseded by `player/src/fade.rs` and the newly-registered `MCR-SPEC002-crossfade.md` (`[INH-*]`), not by anything in `docs/spec/`.* Retained only until every idea of value has been extracted into the current document set — done, per the harvest below — **then deleted**, in the same 2026-08-30 commit that wrote this row's current wording. |
| `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/phase1-plan.md`, `docs/user-interface.md`, `docs/audio-database.md`, `docs/tech-stack-investigation.md`, `docs/cost-estimate.md`, `docs/timeline-estimate.md` | **Added to this register 2026-08-30 — the same disposal-path status as the `docs/spec/*` row above, but never previously named here**, which is how they survived un-superseded and uncited by `README.md`'s own doc index for three weeks after the rearchitecture. Same architecture rejection applies. Two ideas were found in them with no home elsewhere and are now open questions instead of silently lost: Wall Art / Kiosk display mode, and the Phase 7 feature list (station-ID/jingle injection, news/weather TTS, MQTT/smart-home) — see [ROADMAP §3](ROADMAP.md#3-rearchitecture--whats-still-ahead). Nothing else in these seven files is uncaptured elsewhere. The column is now empty — deleted below, per `[GDE-DIS-020]`. |

**`[GDE-DIS-020]`** Deletion is deletion — removed from the working tree, recoverable from git history if ever needed. Do not leave `_old`, `_v1`, or `legacy` directories; that is exactly the pattern McRhythm's own debt analysis flagged as CRITICAL `[GDE-MCR-030]`.

## 8. Rearchitecture Phases — Retrospective

The phased plan is [GUIDE002 §3](GUIDE002-rearchitecture-plan.md#3-phased-plan), tags `[GDE-PHS-000..050]`. What actually shipped, in brief, for each phase now complete. Phases not yet executed are tracked in [ROADMAP §3](ROADMAP.md#3-rearchitecture--whats-still-ahead) instead of here.

**P0 — Local Feature Extraction: done**, per `[GDE-PHS-000]`. Strategy in [GUIDE003](GUIDE003-feature-extraction-strategy.md); reverse-engineering and validation history in [LOG002](LOG002-feature-reproduction-investigation.md) and [LOG003](LOG003-feature-reproduction-verification.md). All 18 AcousticBrainz classifiers reproduce via the reimplemented Gaia/SVM chain (route 2) — maximum error 0.0072 across all eighteen, three exact `[LOG-FEX-102]`. Promoted to production 2026-08-13: `tools/extract_library.py` runs `gaia_classify.py` uniformly across all 71 dimensions, and `data/vaino_new.db` carries locally-extracted flavor for 8,073 of 8,079 radio passages (99.93%) `[LOG-FEX-108]`.

**P1 — Data Foundation: done**, per `[GDE-PHS-010]`. Schema built per `[GDE-ARC-030..040]` ([SPEC008](spec/SPEC008-database-schema.md)); `tools/migrate_mulib.py` imports `mulib.db`. The promoted library carries the full migrated history — 37,134 play events unchanged — alongside uniformly local 71-dimension flavor for every recording `[LOG-FEX-108]`.

**P2 — The Player: done**, per `[GDE-PHS-020]`. Rust streaming engine (`player/src/{decoder,resample,mixer,fade,output,queue}.rs`, `player/src/engine/`, `player/src/web/`, `player/src/db/`) ported from `wkmp-ap`'s design; deployed to the Pi Zero 2W appliance and measured there: 36 MB RSS paused / 53 MB playing — well inside the 150 MB budget — and 15 s power-on to a serving web UI `[PI-CHR-020]`. Hard-power-loss survival is an acceptance target, not yet a measurement — `[IMPL-ACC-010]`'s "10 hard power cuts, no corruption" is a checklist row, and [PI001](../VainoPi/PI001-image-and-partitions.md) §5a says plainly this "has not happened" on real hardware yet.

**P3 — Program Director + Visibility: done**, per `[GDE-PHS-030]`. All four selection stages ([SPEC009](spec/SPEC009-program-director.md) §§3–6) implemented and measured against the real library; the "Why this passage?" panel is the `selection_decisions` record `[SPEC-DIR-190]`. One deliberate, recorded divergence from MuLibPlay: the artist recovery ramp, dead in the shipped C++ via variable shadowing, is implemented as designed in Vaino rather than reproduced as it actually ran `[SPEC-DIR-117]`.

**P5 — Appliance: done, with named gaps**, per `[GDE-PHS-050]`. Fast boot and the 3-partition resilient storage model are built ([PI001](../VainoPi/PI001-image-and-partitions.md)); Bluetooth output is built **and measured on real hardware** ([PI006](../VainoPi/PI006-appliance-characterisation.md)). Two things are built but not yet measured on hardware: the I2S DAC HAT output path (Profile B) has never been run on a device, and hard-power-loss survival has no power-pull test behind it — PI001 §5a says so directly. Wall Art / kiosk display was never built — it remains an open item, see [ROADMAP §3](ROADMAP.md#3-rearchitecture--whats-still-ahead).

*(P4 — Ingest & DAO Segmentation — has not shipped: [SPEC007](spec/SPEC007-sampo-architecture.md) §6 remains explicitly PROVISIONAL on the McRhythm segmentation cascade. See [ROADMAP §3](ROADMAP.md#3-rearchitecture--whats-still-ahead).)*

## 9. Resolved Open Questions

Originally logged in [GUIDE002 §6](GUIDE002-rearchitecture-plan.md#6-open-questions). Items still genuinely open live in [ROADMAP §3](ROADMAP.md#3-rearchitecture--whats-still-ahead) instead.

- **`[GDE-OPN-010]` Dump coverage** — answered 2026-08-09: 93.7% (8,001 of 8,542 recordings), skewing 2.3× worse for post-2013 material `[LOG-FEX-055]`. No longer sizes the extraction work — see `[GDE-FEX-025]`, `[GDE-FEX-027]`, `[SPEC-FD-140]`.
- **`[GDE-OPN-020]` Rust for the player** — confirmed 2026-08-10 on evidence: Vaino v1's Go port shelled out to `mpg123` on Linux, foreclosing sample-accurate crossfade and bounded buffers; McRhythm's Rust stall was in the 71K-line ingest service, not the 27K-line player.
- **`[GDE-OPN-030]` How Taste feeds the Program Director** — answered 2026-08-09 `[SPEC-DIR-150]`: Taste shapes the candidate pool only, never the frequency weights. Dislike-Taste excludes; Like-Taste seeds.
