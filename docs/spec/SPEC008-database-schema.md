# SPEC008: Database Schema

**Design Specification — Tier 2**

The `vaino.db` relational model. Reconciles MuLibPlay's six-years-proven structure `[GDE-BMK-020]` with McRhythm's entity definitions `[GDE-MCR-050]` and the identity/portability rules of [SPEC006](SPEC006-data-flow-and-portability.md).

> **Related:** [SPEC023 Domain Vocabulary](SPEC023-domain-vocabulary.md) for what file/passage/recording/release/album/artist/track each mean and do not mean · [GUIDE002 §2.4](../GUIDE002-rearchitecture-plan.md#2-architectural-decisions) · [SPEC005 Flavor Distance](SPEC005-flavor-distance.md) · [SPEC007 Sampo](SPEC007-sampo-architecture.md) · inherited [MCR-REQ002 Entities](../inherited/mcrhythm/MCR-REQ002-entity_definitions.md)

---

## 1. Governing Rules

**`[SPEC-SC-010]` `vaino.db` is a cache, never a source** `[SPEC-DF-010]`. Everything except listener state is re-derivable from audio by Sampo. Deleting the database must cost time, not information.

**`[SPEC-SC-015]` No field without a consumer** `[GDE-FBD-060]`. MuLibPlay carried `tempo`, `intensity`, `keyMood`, `darkLight`, `genre`, `themes` as NULL for all 8,116 rows across six years `[GDE-BMK-040]`. None are reproduced here.

**`[SPEC-SC-020]` Class D is physically segregated.** Listener state lives in tables prefixed `listener_` so the class-D export `[SPEC-DF-090]` is a table-set selection rather than a column-by-column judgement, and so "never travels with music" `[SPEC-DF-055]` is enforced by structure.

**`[SPEC-SC-025]` Provenance is non-nullable wherever a value was derived** `[GDE-FBD-020]`. The failure this prevents — 91% of v1's descriptors being silently inherited rather than computed `[GDE-V1-010]` — was invisible precisely because nothing recorded origin.

---

## 2. Identity Spine

**`[SPEC-SC-030]`** Three scopes, three keys `[SPEC-DF-030]`. Every table binds at exactly one.

```sql
-- Encoding scope: this exact audio. audio_md5 is Essentia's md5_encoded,
-- stable across tag writes [SPEC-DF-020], free at extraction [SPEC-SA-035].
CREATE TABLE files (
    file_id      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    audio_md5    TEXT    NOT NULL UNIQUE,   -- identity; survives move/rename/retag
    path         TEXT    NOT NULL,          -- machine scope: never transported
    size_bytes   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    mtime        REAL    NOT NULL,          -- cheap change detection only
    format       TEXT    NOT NULL,
    duration_ms  INTEGER NOT NULL,          -- decoded, not header-claimed [REQ-LIB-145]
    first_seen   TEXT    NOT NULL,
    last_seen    TEXT    NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX files_path ON files(path);

-- Recording scope: this music, any encoding. Portable across installations.
CREATE TABLE recordings (
    mbid       TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    title      TEXT NOT NULL,
    length_ms  INTEGER,
    source     TEXT NOT NULL                -- [SPEC-SC-025]
);
```

**`[SPEC-SC-035]` `path` is deliberately not unique and never a key.** MuLibPlay's ability to relocate a moved library came from matching content, not paths `[GDE-BMK-050]`; that property is preserved by keying on `audio_md5`.

---

## 3. Passages — the Album/Radio Duality

**`[SPEC-SC-040]`** A passage is a span of one file with its own playback metadata `[ENT-MP-030]`, `[SPEC023]`. MuLibPlay's best structural idea `[GDE-BMK-030]`: **each recording-in-file span yields two passages, one per `kind`**, and the Program Director selects only `radio`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE passages (
    passage_id     INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    file_id        INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES files(file_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    kind           TEXT    NOT NULL CHECK (kind IN ('album','radio')),
    start_ms       INTEGER NOT NULL,
    end_ms         INTEGER NOT NULL,
    lead_in_ms     INTEGER,                  -- computed [SPEC-SA-075]; NULL = not analysed
    lead_out_ms    INTEGER,
    gain_db        REAL,                     -- loudness match; MuLibPlay observed ~0.70-0.75 linear
    boundary_src   TEXT    NOT NULL,         -- 'computed:<algo>@<ver>' | 'manual' | 'imported:<x>'
    CHECK (end_ms > start_ms)
);
CREATE INDEX passages_file ON passages(file_id);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX passages_span ON passages(file_id, kind, start_ms, end_ms);
```

**`tools/add_fade_columns.py` grows `passages` past this base shape**, the same layering `tools/fetch_releases.py` uses for `releases` (§3b): it idempotently `ALTER TABLE`s in `fade_in_ms`/`fade_out_ms` (`INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 20`) and `fade_in_curve`/`fade_out_curve` (`TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'exponential'`) — this passage's own volume envelope `[SPEC-SC-046]`, described below.

**`[SPEC-SC-043]` Lead durations are normally milliseconds, deliberately.** Across the migrated library the lead-in median is **5 ms** and the lead-out median **946 ms**. **Lead does not itself apply any gain ramp** `[SPEC-SC-046]` — it only times *when* a crossfade with a neighbour is permitted, never *how loud* either side is during it — so these numbers control overlap duration, not loudness shape. Near-zero overlap `[SPEC-DIR-*]` is therefore the intended default, and these values should not be inflated to "enable crossfading": doing so widens the window a crossfade is *allowed* to use, but produces no audible blend on its own. Audible crossfade is the uncommon case, and reaching it needs two things set together, not one: a long-enough `lead_out_ms`/`lead_in_ms` to admit the overlap, *and* a comparably long `fade_out_ms`/`fade_in_ms` `[SPEC-SC-046]` to actually ramp gain across it — every passage's fixed 20 ms fade default will not produce a slow blend even inside a long lead window, since it finishes in the first 20 ms of whatever `lead_out_ms` admits.

Reviewable and overridable, both, through the waveform boundary editor `[SPEC021]`.

**`[SPEC-SC-046]` Fade is orthogonal to lead, and is now the entire audible envelope** `[SPEC-SUI-226]`, per McRhythm's own inherited distinction (`[XFD-ORTH-010]`): `lead_in_ms`/`lead_out_ms` time *when a crossfade with a neighbour is permitted*; `fade_in_ms`/`fade_out_ms` are this passage's *own* volume envelope, applied whether or not anything neighbours it. This supersedes, not supplements, an earlier asymmetry: before this column existed, `lead_in_ms` was genuinely applied as a real fade-in gain ramp and `lead_out_ms` was not applied as one at all — `engine.rs::open()` now builds its `Envelope` entirely from the four fade columns, and `lead_in_ms`/`lead_out_ms` no longer reach the mixer as a gain ramp in any form, on either side. `analyze_amplitude.py` never touches the four fade columns — they carry a fixed default (20 ms, `exponential`), not a computed one, and exist purely so no passage ever starts or ends at an arbitrary, potentially non-zero sample: a hard click at a file boundary, or an abrupt cut into/out of continuous audio (a DAO capture, a live recording) that has no silence of its own to lead into. Always user-editable per side, independently of `lead_in_ms`/`lead_out_ms` and of each other, through the waveform boundary editor `[SPEC021]`.

Not to be confused with `skip_fade_ms`/`skip_lead_ms` `[REQ-AUD-162]` — a third, unrelated use of both "fade" and "lead": live-adjustable Skip parameters held on `Engine` itself (`engine.rs`), never read from or written to `passages`, and never in effect during ordinary playback. `skip_fade_ms` times the outgoing passage's own fade-out; `skip_lead_ms` times when the *incoming* one starts relative to that fade-out — neither is a duration measured from a passage's own start/end the way `lead_in_ms`/`fade_in_ms` are. Only the *local, same-backend* handoff (an emptied queue's fade-out, `[SPEC-BK-033]`) actually runs through these fields; a cross-backend handoff (`Session::hand_over_seamless`, `session.rs`/`switch.rs`) uses its own fixed constants (`vaino.rs`'s `600` ms fade, `HANDOFF_LEAD_MS=250`), not the listener's skip settings at all.

**`[SPEC-SC-047]` What `radio` and `album` actually change.** Both are the *same* recording-in-file span, played back two different ways — see `[SPEC023]` for the term itself:

- **`radio`**: trimmed toward minimal start/end silence, meant for freeform rotation play; `lead_in_ms`/`lead_out_ms` set the timing window in which this passage's tail may overlap the next one's head, and `fade_in_ms`/`fade_out_ms` are the audible ramp, per `[SPEC-SC-046]` above.
- **`album`**: preserves whatever between-track silence the source actually has — commonly present, never guaranteed — the span a listener hears playing straight through. On a DAO capture specifically, consecutive `album`-kind passages **abut exactly**: one's `end_ms` is the next's `start_ms`, no gap and no overlap, so playing them in sequence reproduces an uninterrupted full-disc listen, shaped only by each passage's own (typically minimal) fade.

Neither `kind` implies anything about whether the underlying recording or file belongs to a catalogued MusicBrainz release — see `[SPEC023]`'s "Album" entry for that distinct, informal sense of the word.

**`[SPEC-SC-045]` `boundary_src` distinguishing `manual` is what makes override durable** `[SPEC-SA-080]`. Recomputation must never overwrite a `manual` row; conflict resolution ranks provenance before recency `[SPEC-DF-070]`.

**`[SPEC-SC-050]` Passage → recording is many-to-many with weights**, because a passage may contain a medley and a recording may appear in many files. Unidentified passages simply have no rows here — legal, and playable `[ENT-MP-035]`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE passage_recordings (
    passage_id  INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES passages(passage_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    mbid        TEXT    NOT NULL REFERENCES recordings(mbid),
    weight      REAL    NOT NULL DEFAULT 1.0,
    source      TEXT    NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (passage_id, mbid)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

---

## 3b. Artists, Releases and Credits

**`[SPEC-SC-048]`** `artists` and `releases` are MusicBrainz-keyed entities shaped exactly like `recordings` above (`[SPEC-SC-030]`). `recording_artists` is the weighted junction onto them, shaped like `passage_recordings`. `release_recordings` is not weighted — it has no `weight` column at all — because a track's placement on a release is a fact, not a probabilistic credit; it is instead an *ordered* junction (`position`/`chosen`/`disc`, below). Base DDL for all four lives in [`sql/schema.sql`](../../sql/schema.sql) — this section explains what they're for and how they relate, not a second hand-typed copy of the columns, which is exactly how this section went stale before: it previously said "follow the same shape... omitted for length," which stopped being true the moment `release_recordings` grew `position`/`chosen`/`disc`/`track_length_ms` of its own.

**Migrations grow `releases` past its base shape.** `sql/schema.sql` bootstraps a fresh database; `tools/fetch_releases.py` idempotently `ALTER TABLE`s in `release_group`/`status`/`primary_type`/`secondary_types`/`country`/`track_count` the first time a library needs release identification (`[SPEC010 §3]`) — the same layering `tools/add_fade_columns.py` uses for `passages`' own fade columns (`[SPEC-SC-046]`).

**What each junction is for**, in terms `[SPEC023]` (Domain Vocabulary) names precisely:

- **`recording_artists`** — a recording's credit is a *weighted set*, never a single value (`[SPEC023]` Artist): a collaboration or featured credit is a genuine multi-row entry, and `apply_reviews.py --revert-artist` corrects one recording's whole credit set at a time (`[SPEC010 §3]`).
- **`release_recordings`** — one row is Vaino's realization of Track (`[SPEC023]` Track, inherited `[ENT-MB-010]`): a recording's position (`position`/`disc`) on one specific release. `chosen` is the flag SPEC010's release disambiguation writes when a recording sits on more than one catalogued release, which per `[SPEC023]`'s Release entry is the ordinary case, not an anomaly to resolve away.

---

## 4. Flavor

**`[SPEC-SC-060]`** Long and narrow, not 71 columns. Three reasons, each measured: partial vectors are normal (11 dims from `mulib.db`, 71 from the dump, some locally computed); provenance is **per characteristic**, not per track `[GDE-ARC-030]`; and user-defined characteristics `[GDE-MCR-060]` must be addable without DDL changes.

```sql
CREATE TABLE flavor (
    subject_kind    TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (subject_kind IN ('recording','passage')),
    subject_id      TEXT NOT NULL,          -- recordings.mbid | passages.passage_id
    characteristic  TEXT NOT NULL,          -- 'mood_happy', 'genre_dortmund', 'user.christmas'
    class           TEXT NOT NULL,          -- 'happy', 'rock', 'christmasy'
    value           REAL NOT NULL CHECK (value >= 0.0 AND value <= 1.0),
    source          TEXT NOT NULL,          -- [SPEC-SC-025]
    accuracy        REAL,                   -- measured err/beta for this characteristic
    PRIMARY KEY (subject_kind, subject_id, characteristic, class)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
CREATE INDEX flavor_subject ON flavor(subject_kind, subject_id);
```

**`[SPEC-SC-065]` Two subject kinds, deliberately.** Recording-scope flavor is portable and shareable `[SPEC-DF-040]`; passage-scope covers audio with no MusicBrainz identity, which must still be selectable. A passage prefers its own flavor and falls back to its recording's.

**`[SPEC-SC-070]` `accuracy` is populated from the model manifest, per subject and characteristic** — but does not currently feed the distance metric. `[SPEC-FD-120]` originally specified scaling `w_c` by it; that premise was superseded once the library moved to uniform-local provenance `[SPEC-FD-150]`, where every recording shares one extractor and there is no per-recording accuracy signal left to weight by. `w_c` in `player/src/director/flavor.rs` is a single corpus-wide reliability per characteristic (`[SPEC-FD-052]`), not a per-value one built from this column.

**`[SPEC-SC-075]` Classes of a characteristic must sum to 1.0 ± 1e-4** `[MFL-DEF-040]`. Not expressible as a SQL constraint; enforced on write and audited in bulk. Verified clean on 21,636 of 21,636 instances in the sample dump.

---

## 5. Derivation Cache

**`[SPEC-SC-080]` The lowlevel cache is the most valuable table in the database** and the reason S4 and S5 are separate stages `[SPEC-SA-025]`. Extraction costs ~27 s/track and is the only step needing audio decode. Improving a classifier must re-run S5 over cached features and **never re-decode a user's library** `[GDE-CHT-045]`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE lowlevel_cache (
    audio_md5   TEXT    NOT NULL,
    start_ms    INTEGER NOT NULL,           -- 0,-1 = whole file; else the passage slice
    end_ms      INTEGER NOT NULL,
    features    BLOB    NOT NULL,           -- compressed Essentia lowlevel JSON
    extractor   TEXT    NOT NULL,           -- 'essentia-v2.1_beta2-1-ge3940c0'
    extracted_at TEXT   NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (audio_md5, start_ms, end_ms)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

Keyed by slice because extraction is per-passage `[SPEC-SA-090]` — **provisional**: that experiment may add a minimum-duration or eligibility rule, which would be an additional column here, not a restructuring.

**`[SPEC-SC-085]`** Identification lookups (`fpcalc` fingerprints, AcoustID and MusicBrainz responses) are cached in the same spirit: the AcoustID key is rate-limited and a single point of failure `[SPEC-SA-055]`, so a re-run must never re-query.

---

## 6. Listener State — Class D

**`[SPEC-SC-090]`** Segregated by prefix `[SPEC-SC-020]`. This is the **only irreplaceable data in the system** `[SPEC-DF-090]`; everything else re-derives from audio.

```sql
CREATE TABLE listener_play_history (          -- 37,134 rows in MuLibPlay since 2020
    play_id     INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    played_at   INTEGER NOT NULL,             -- unix seconds
    passage_id  INTEGER REFERENCES passages(passage_id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    mbid        TEXT,                         -- survives passage deletion
    heard_ms    INTEGER,                      -- how much was heard [REQ-VIS-250]
    span_ms     INTEGER                       -- how long the passage was; both NULL on rows predating the columns
);
CREATE INDEX listener_play_time ON listener_play_history(played_at);
CREATE INDEX listener_play_mbid ON listener_play_history(mbid);

CREATE TABLE listener_preferences (           -- MuLibPlay's rotation/recovery/restraint
    subject_kind TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (subject_kind IN ('recording','artist')),
    subject_id   TEXT NOT NULL,
    rotation     REAL,                        -- log scale: 10^v hours [GDE-PD-010]
    recovery     REAL,
    restraint    REAL,
    updated_at   TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (subject_kind, subject_id)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

`listener_programs` / `listener_program_seeds` hold the time-of-day programs as **seed track lists** `[GDE-PD-040]`, and `listener_likes` holds weighted Like/Dislike events with their timestamps `[GDE-MCR-070]`.

Five more `listener_`-prefixed tables complete Class D. `listener_rejections` records a skip or dequeue only so the same passage is not re-offered immediately `[SPEC-PLAY-050]`; it feeds no ramp, count or artist damping. `listener_settings` is the single-row home for the artist/recording rotation-scale master multipliers and the appliance's `utc_offset_minutes` for wall-clock programme starts `[SPEC-DIR-118]`. `listener_occasions` and `listener_occasion_points` hold seasonal curves as data, not code — a new occasion is rows here plus `flavor` values, never an engine edit `[SPEC-DIR-130]`. `listener_flags` is a plain "look at this" marker a listener sets from a play-history row, carrying no verdict of its own `[REQ-VIS-265]`.

**`[SPEC-SC-095]` `mbid` is denormalised into play history on purpose.** MuLibPlay did the same, and it means six years of history survives a library rescan that renumbers passages.

---

## 6b. Player State

**`[SPEC-SC-098]`** A single row holding the resume point `[REQ-AUD-140]`: passage, position, playing flag, volume.

Deliberately **not** `listener_`-prefixed. It is operational state, not listener history — losing it costs one track position — so it is excluded from the class-D export `[SPEC-DF-090]`, which exists for data that cannot be reconstructed. Mixing it in would dilute the one guarantee that export makes.

`playing` is a boolean because playback has exactly two states `[REQ-AUD-142]`. Pausing halts the consumer only; producers keep filling buffers, so there is no third "stopped" mode to represent.

**`[SPEC-SC-099]` Settings are rows in `player_settings`, not columns beside the resume point.** *(Changed 2026-08-22.)* They began as columns on `player_state`, one added by `ALTER` as each was invented, and read back **by position** — `?11` in the insert, `r.get(10)` in the select. Adding a setting meant renumbering both lists and the `ALTER` list beside them, and getting it wrong loaded the wrong value **silently** rather than failing.

`player_settings(key, value, updated_at)` removes the positions. One list of keys is the source, and a round-trip test asserts that what is written is what is read, so a setting added to the struct and forgotten in the reader fails a test instead of losing itself at the next restart.

The keys keep the old column names, so a database written before this carries over without a translation table — done once, on open, and skipped forever after.

---

## 7. Visibility

**`[SPEC-SC-100]`** `ingest_decisions` records what each Sampo stage decided, at what confidence, and what it rejected — a durable record, not a log line `[SPEC-SA-085]`. `selection_decisions` records the Program Director's weight decomposition per choice, which is what the "Why this passage?" panel reads `[GDE-CHT-030]`.

Both are append-only, bounded by retention, and are **Vaino-local**: they describe process, not music, so they never travel `[SPEC-DF-050]`.

---

## 8. Open

1. **`[SPEC-SC-110]`** Per-passage extraction may add a minimum-duration or flavor-eligibility column `[SPEC-SA-090]`. Additive.
2. **`[SPEC-SC-115]`** Cover art storage — MuLibPlay held BLOBs in `albums` (95 MB db, mostly art). Filesystem cache keyed by release MBID is likely better; not yet decided.
3. **`[SPEC-SC-120]`** Retention policy for the two decision tables.

---

**Traceability:** `[SPEC-SC-010..120]` · derived from `[GDE-ARC-040]`, `[GDE-BMK-030]`, `[SPEC-DF-030]`, `[SPEC-SA-025]`
