# PI003: Choosing a Speaker

**Design — Tier 2**

How a listener picks their Bluetooth speaker from the Vaino settings panel, and
why the obvious implementation of that is broken.

## 1. What this has to survive

Every requirement below is the residue of a specific failure on real hardware,
recorded in [PI002 §6a](PI002-test-image-setup.md). None of them is
hypothetical, and the naive version of this feature reproduces all of them.

**`[PI3-WHY-010]` PipeWire always offers a `Dummy Output`.** When no sink is
present it invents one, and it is a perfectly good sink: a player attached to
it plays flawlessly, forever, into nothing, reporting itself healthy from every
angle. Two days of this problem were spent looking at Bluetooth because the
player insisted it was fine.

**`[PI3-WHY-020]` A stream sometimes follows a change of default sink, and
sometimes does not.** This is the awkward one, and the reason the fault took so
long to place.

Tested deliberately: with the speaker untrusted and disconnected, the player
starts and binds to `Dummy Output`. Reconnecting the speaker then relinked the
stream to MIDDLETON **by itself**, same node ids, no reopen. But the original
failure was precisely a stream sitting on `Dummy Output` while the speaker was
connected, staying there, and playing to nobody.

Both were observed on the same machine. So the relink is real but not
dependable -- plausibly a race between the dummy being removed and the sink
appearing -- and a design that relies on it works most of the time, which is
the worst frequency for a fault to have.

**Therefore "select a speaker" must reopen the output rather than change the
default and hope.** Not because the stream never follows, but because it
cannot be trusted to, and a cosmetic selection is silent.

**`[PI3-WHY-030]` A2DP dies when nothing feeds it.** A speaker with no audio
hangs up after a few seconds, and the listener hears a disconnection tone. This
makes every silent failure above *sound like* a Bluetooth fault, which is
exactly the wrong place to look.

**`[PI3-WHY-040]` `pair` and `trust` are separate, and only `trust` survives a
reboot.** Pairing without trusting yields a speaker that works beautifully until
the appliance restarts, then never reconnects.

**`[PI3-WHY-050]` A stale trusted-but-not-paired record blocks re-pairing
silently.** BlueZ keeps the entry, `pair` fails, and nothing explains why. The
fix is to `remove` the device first, which no listener will ever guess.

**`[PI3-WHY-060]` Pairing needs a registered agent.** Without
`agent NoInputNoOutput` the exchange never completes, and the failure is a
timeout rather than a message.

## 2. The shape of it

**`[PI3-UI-010]` One list, showing what is true.** The settings panel shows
every known and discoverable speaker in a single list, each with a state that
is *observed* rather than assumed:

| State | Meaning | Offered action |
|---|---|---|
| `playing` | connected, and Vaino's stream is attached to it | Forget |
| `connected` | linked, but audio is going elsewhere | Use this one |
| `paired` | known, not currently linked | Connect |
| `found` | in range, never paired | Pair |
| `stale` | trusted but not paired `[PI3-WHY-050]` | Repair |

The distinction between `playing` and `connected` is the entire lesson of
`[PI3-WHY-010]` made visible. A user who sees "connected" and hears nothing has
been told something useful; a user who sees a checkmark has been lied to.

**`[PI3-UI-020]` Selecting a speaker performs the whole sequence.** Connect,
trust, make default, **and reopen Vaino's output** -- the last step being the
one `[PI3-WHY-020]` makes mandatory and the one nobody would think to expose.
A selection that stops short of it appears to work and is silent.

**`[PI3-UI-030]` Confirm or revert, as for the network settings
`[PI-SET-014]`.** Switching speakers can destroy the means of hearing whether
the switch worked. So the new speaker is adopted provisionally, the panel asks
"can you hear this?" over a test tone, and an unanswered prompt returns to the
previous sink after 30 seconds. The listener cannot strand themselves in
silence by choosing wrongly.

**`[PI3-UI-040]` Pairing is a mode, not a button.** The panel offers "put my
speaker in pairing mode, then press this", scans for the ~20 s a speaker takes
to appear, and registers an agent for the duration `[PI3-WHY-060]`. Discovery
stops afterwards, because a permanently scanning radio is a permanently
degraded one on a shared antenna.

## 3. What the player must provide

**`[PI3-API-010]` Reopen the output on demand. Built and proven on hardware.**
`POST /command/reopen-output` rebuilds the stream against the current default
sink, keeping the same ring. Verified by the output node id changing and by
`pw-top` showing the rebuilt node running at 1102 quantum, 44100, F32LE 2ch,
with playback continuing across the reopen. A reopen that lands on a device not
ready yet -- a speaker still completing its connection is the normal case --
hands itself to the retry loop rather than failing once.

**`[PI3-API-020]` Report the sink actually in use, not the one requested.**
The player knows only `default` through ALSA `[PI3-WHY-020]`, so the true
answer lives in PipeWire and must be read from there. "Which node is my stream
linked to" is the question, and `Dummy Output` is a first-class answer that the
interface must be willing to show.

**`[PI3-API-030]` Never start playing into a dummy.** The `vaino-wait-sink`
guard covers boot. The same check belongs behind the reopen, so a mid-session
selection cannot land the player back in the silent state.

**`[PI3-API-040]` Surface the recovery count `[REQ-VIS-140]`.** A link that
drops and recovers repeatedly is a range or battery problem, and a number
climbing in the diagnostics is how anyone would know. Silent recovery is right
for one dropout and wrong for fifty.

## 4. Privilege

The BlueZ operations need more than the web process should hold. This is the
privileged helper already required by `[PI-SET-030]`, and speaker selection is
its second caller rather than a new mechanism: a narrow, enumerated set of
verbs -- scan, pair, trust, connect, forget -- with the device address as the
only argument, and no shell interpolation anywhere in it.

---

## 5. Deliberately not now

**`[PI3-NOT-010]` Interference is not being designed around.** The dark arm of
`radio-silence-test.sh` exists to answer that question and has not been run,
because with Wi-Fi up the link now measures 40/40 across two minutes with audio
flowing. Should unexplained connection problems appear, that test is the tool
to reach for. Building mitigations for a problem not yet observed would be
designing against a guess.

**`[PI3-NOT-020]` Multiple simultaneous sinks.** One speaker, chosen. Whole-house
audio is a different product.
