# PI010: Startup Time, and Hunting a Stutter

**Appliance Record — where 19 seconds went, and four causes that were not it**

Split from [PI004](PI004-speaker-operation.md) on 2026-09-08. Continues
[PI009](PI009-the-silence-of-2026-09-08.md). Memory, swap, CPU starvation and
SD contention were each proposed for the periodic stuttering and each measured
away here; the answer is in [PI011](PI011-two-speakers-and-placement.md).

The instruments built to settle it — and the one that had to be rewritten
because it was a suspect in its own measurements — are documented in §3, with
the commands to switch them on again.

## 1. Startup stutter, and the observer that caused some of it

**`[PI3-FOUND-170]` Diagnosing this over ssh perturbs the thing being
measured.** The Pi Zero 2W puts Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on one chip behind one
antenna, so a `journalctl` dump competes directly with the A2DP stream it is
being used to investigate. On the first boot with a persistent journal to
read, the ssh login landed at 60.4 s and the reported stutters at roughly
80 s, 97 s and 101 s — during the diagnosis, not merely near it. Some earlier
"stuttery audio" reports coincide with active diagnosis in the same way.

This is not the whole explanation — stutter was also reported on cycles with
nobody connected — but it is enough to invalidate any measurement taken over
ssh while listening. `vaino-startup-sample` exists for that reason: a boot-time
service that reads `/proc` once a second into a local file, with no network,
no subprocesses in its loop, `Nice=19` and idle I/O. It can run while the
listener simply listens, and be read afterwards with the appliance quiet.

**`[PI3-FOUND-180]` No audio thread on this appliance has real-time priority,
and the usual ways of granting it do not work here.** Measured: `pipewire`'s
`data-loop.0` — the thread that encodes SBC and feeds A2DP — runs
`SCHED_OTHER` at priority 0 carrying `SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK`, which is the
fingerprint of a request made and refused. `rtkit-daemon` confirms it, once a
minute: *"Supervising 0 threads of 0 processes of 0 users."* The cause is a
hard limit: `/proc/<pipewire>/limits` reads `Max realtime priority 0 0`.

Three fixes were tried and **none of them worked**, which is the part worth
recording:

- Adding the account to the `pipewire` group, the usual advice. Debian's
  `@pipewire - rtprio 95` is applied by `pam_limits`, and **`/etc/pam.d/systemd-user`
  does not exist on this image**, so no PAM limits reach a systemd *user*
  session — which is where PipeWire runs.
- `LimitRTPRIO=95` as a drop-in on `user@.service`. `systemctl show` duly
  reported 95 for the instance, and the manager process still came up with a
  hard limit of 0.
- `DefaultLimitRTPRIO=95` in `/etc/systemd/system.conf`, with `daemon-reexec`
  and across a full reboot. The manager default read 95; PID 1 itself and the
  user manager both still read 0.

All three were reverted rather than left in place, because configuration that
looks like it grants real time and does not is worse than none. Whether RT is
even the right target is unproven: `pw-top` shows the audio thread using 2–4%
of its quantum with zero xruns in steady state, so it has considerable headroom
and would need a >20 ms scheduling delay to glitch. Establish that such delays
actually occur before spending more on this.

**The upower remedy recorded above never survived a reboot, and this is
why.** `systemctl enable --now upower` worked — for that session.
`upower.service` ships `WantedBy=graphical.target`, and this appliance boots
to `multi-user.target` with no display, so enabling it creates a want that is
never reached. Every boot since has come up with `upower` *enabled* and
*inactive*, and WirePlumber has logged
`Failed to get percentage from UPower: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NameHasNoOwner`
each time. The verb that actually holds on a headless appliance is
`systemctl add-wants multi-user.target upower.service`, which is now in place.

Worth noting what this did **not** turn out to explain: the error appears
exactly once per boot here, at about 13 s, not on the repeating ~2.5 minute
sweep that `[PI3-FOUND-030]` originally described, and the startup stutter
being investigated happens at 63-80 s. Fixed because it is a known hazard and
the fix is one line, not because it was the cause.

**`[PI3-FOUND-190]` What the startup stutter is not.** With a sampler running
unattended (`vaino-startup-sample`, no ssh connected), the window the listener
reported as stuttering — 63 s to 80 s — shows: swap counters static, 216 MB
available, the player using about 5% of one core, and zero xruns. The load
average sits near 1.4 but is a lagging average decaying from the library index
build at 27-50 s, not live work. So it is not memory, not swap, not CPU
starvation, and not the player missing its ring.

What remains is the radio. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth share one chip and one antenna
on a Pi Zero 2W, DHCP completed at 56.9 s and the NetworkManager dispatcher ran
57-67 s — overlapping the start of the stutter exactly — and no amount of CPU
headroom prevents an antenna being used by something else. Since that cannot be
removed, the lever is margin: the graph was running a 1024-frame quantum, about
21 ms, so any interruption longer than that glitches. `default.clock.min-quantum`
is now 2048, which doubles the tolerance to about 46 ms, at a latency cost that
is meaningless for music with no synchronised display.

**`[PI3-FOUND-330]` It was written off as useless, deleted, and its removal
was the regression.** The cold boot after this change stuttered exactly as
before, so it was recorded as having fixed nothing and later removed as dead
configuration. **That test was confounded** — the appliance was still sitting
on the speaker `[PI3-FOUND-320]`, a fault large enough to hide whatever the
buffer was doing.

Deleting the drop-in brought the stuttering straight back, on a boot eighteen
inches clear of the speaker with everything else as it had been through two
clean power cycles. The only difference was the quantum: 2048 while clean,
1024 once removed. So both mattered and neither alone sufficed — moving the
box stops the antenna being detuned, and the wider quantum carries the stream
over what interference remains. 1024 frames, about 21 ms, is not enough here.
Restored, this time on evidence rather than on the absence of it.

**`[PI3-FOUND-200]` Some of the early silence was the player starving its own
ring, and every other instrument said the machine was fine.** (Read the
qualifier: this accounts for the *startup* underruns, not for the periodic
stuttering that outlasted them — that was `[PI3-FOUND-320]`, and underrun
counts turn out not to predict audibility at all.) After ruling out memory,
swap, CPU and PipeWire xruns, the measurement that had not been taken was the
player's own:

```
$ vaino-underruns
underrun_samples   654768  (14.85s at 44.1kHz)
lock_failures      1
```

Fourteen and a half seconds of samples the output ring could not supply, in a
startup where `pw-top` reported **zero** xruns, `free` showed 216 MB
available, the swap counters never moved, and the player used about 5% of one
core. None of those instruments could have shown it: from PipeWire's side
nothing went wrong — it was handed silence and delivered silence faithfully.

Sampled three times ten seconds apart afterwards, the counter did not move.
So the whole 14.85 s accrued during startup and stopped, which is exactly the
shape the listener reported: stuttering as playback begins, clean later.

**5% of a core while starving means blocked, not slow.** The player is not
compute-bound during that window; it is waiting. What it waits on is the SD
card, which has just been asked to read a 1.1 GB library database — flushing
the page cache and saturating the queue immediately before playback begins.
The player then had no explicit I/O class at all, only whatever its `Nice=-5`
implied, and 128 KB of readahead for sequential audio files.

Two changes, both cheap and both at the level the problem actually lives:
`IOSchedulingClass=best-effort` with `IOSchedulingPriority=0` on
`vaino.service`, and readahead raised to 512 KB through `tmpfiles.d`.

**Outcome, across the cold boots that followed:** startup underruns did fall
a long way — 654,768 samples to 118,346 — but attributing that to these two
changes would be wrong, because `mpd` was made to yield in the same window
`[PI3-FOUND-210]` and that is the change with a measured 19 s → 1.9 s behind
it. Worse, the process-wide I/O priority here is too blunt to be the right
shape: it raises the Director rebuild along with the decoder, which is the
opposite of what `[PI3-FOUND-220]` then had to arrange per-thread. Both are
kept as harmless and defensible, neither is evidence of anything.

The durable answer is almost certainly the one vainoplayer3 already has:
deferring the library/Director build off the resume path, so the card is not
being saturated in the seconds before audio starts. That needs a
cross-compiled binary rather than a configuration change.

`vaino-underruns` exists so this is never again invisible: the counter is
published only over the websocket, and nothing on the appliance could read it.

## 2. Where the startup time and the stutters actually went

**`[PI3-FOUND-210]` `Session::open` was never slow; it was starved.**
Instrumented and measured on the appliance, the phases read:

```
warm restart   session open: library 8ms, store 10ms, resume-load 0ms, utc-sync 1ms (total 19ms)
caches dropped session open: total 25ms,  prime 712ms
cold boot      session open: library 474ms ... (total 489ms), prime 690ms
```

Nineteen *milliseconds* of work had been taking nineteen *seconds* on a boot.
Nothing in the function was expensive; it was competing with everything else
starting at once on four small cores and one SD card, and the boot journal
shows a fifteen-second silence across the window in which nothing logged and
the machine was plainly busy. A sidecar to skip the library open — the
obvious fix, and one seriously considered — would have saved 19 ms.

The remedy was to stop the competition instead: `mpd`, a guest backend that
is configured but idle until switched to `[SPEC-BK-020]`, now runs
`IOSchedulingClass=idle` and `Nice=10`. On the next cold boot the whole
player startup was **1.9 s** (32.4 s to 34.3 s), and underruns fell from
654,768 samples to 102,266 — 14.85 s of missing audio to 2.32 s.

**`[PI3-FOUND-220]` The rest of the stutters were the Director rebuild,
which left no trace.** With the player itself starting in under two seconds,
the listener still heard stutters at 46 s, 61 s, 76 s, 89 s and 96 s. The
first two were the radio: `wpa_supplicant` re-associating, alternately with
two access points on the same SSID at near-identical strength (56 and 54, both
channel 1, no BSSID pinned), each attempt costing antenna time the A2DP link
needs. Those settled at 64 s and never recurred.

The last three were the Director rebuild — a flavor index over 8,330 radio
passages, **measured at 16.5 s and 10.3 s**, running at the same priority as
the thread feeding the speaker, and logging absolutely nothing. That silence
is why its stutters were attributed to the radio for most of an evening.

`RELOAD_MIN_QUEUE_MS` already decided *when* it may start and decided it
well. Nothing decided how hard it should push once running. It now calls
`step_aside()` first — `setpriority` and `ioprio_set`, both per-thread on
Linux, so the engine keeps everything it has and only the rebuild yields —
and reports its duration.

> lost to work that used to be audible. `vaino-underruns` is what made that a
> number rather than an opinion.

**`[PI3-FOUND-230]` The keeper's own polling was audible.** Every
`bluetoothctl` invocation opens a D-Bus connection and enumerates the
adapter's objects, and `vaino-speaker` had grown to three or four of them per
tick — trust, connected-list, audio-sink, alias — against a daemon that is at
that moment carrying an A2DP stream. Measured on a boot where the player
started in 1.9 s and the Director rebuild had already been made polite: the
listener's stutters at 120 s and 151 s land on the timer's own ticks at 118 s
and 153 s.

All of it is in one `info` block, so it is fetched once and read several
times, and the connected-device search is skipped entirely when the speaker
on record is the one connected — the case that runs every thirty seconds
forever. A tick now costs 0.245 s rather than 0.4 s, and one round trip to
BlueZ rather than four. Verified against all three branches afterwards: trust
self-heal still repairs an untrusted speaker and persists it, a healthy tick
is silent, and a routing mismatch still asks the player to reopen.

**The Wi-Fi roam-flap is left alone, deliberately.** Two access points share
the SSID at near-identical strength and the client re-associates between
them, each attempt costing antenna time the A2DP link needs — the listener's
stutters at 46 s and 61 s on one boot were exactly this. Pinning a BSSID
would stop it, and was declined on purpose: *"accessibility is more important
than temporary radio instability"* — the appliance is headless and that Wi-Fi
is the only way to reach it, so a pin that outlives the AP it names would
cost far more than the stutters do. Recorded so the option is not
rediscovered and quietly taken later.
