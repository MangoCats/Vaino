"""Build a small library from a full one, and put it on a VainoPi.

The full library here is 43.9 GB across 7,450 files. Waiting on that transfer
to find out whether the Pi plays at all is the wrong order: PI002 asks four
questions -- does it play, how long does it boot, how much memory does it take,
does Bluetooth survive a crossfade -- and a few albums answer all four.

**Idempotent.** The database is rebuilt only when the selection changes, audio
is copied only when absent, and the deploy is a sync. Re-running is the
supported way to add albums or to repair a partial transfer.

Python rather than shell because the subset is a dozen related DELETEs and the
paths are Windows paths going to a Linux box; the quoting alone justifies it.
