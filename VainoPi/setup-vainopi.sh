# pipewire-alsa is the one left out and then impossible to explain. Vaino
# reaches the sound card through cpal, which speaks ALSA; a Bluetooth speaker
# is a PipeWire sink with no ALSA device of its own. This package installs the
# plugin that routes ALSA's default PCM into PipeWire. Without it the player
# says "no audio device" beside a speaker that is paired, trusted, connected
# and visibly working for everything else -- ALSA error 524, which names
# nothing. With it the error becomes an honest "Host is down" when the link
# drops.
# upower is not optional here, whatever it looks like on a mains-powered box
# with no battery. WirePlumber asks it for a Bluetooth device's charge level,
# and when the D-Bus name has no owner it tears down and rebuilds every A2DP
# endpoint -- roughly every two and a half minutes, with the radio idle. A2DP
# does not survive its endpoints being withdrawn, so the speaker drops, and it
# sounds exactly like interference `[PI3-FOUND-030]`.
# dnsmasq and iw are for the Wi-Fi settings page `[SPEC034]`: dnsmasq is
# what NetworkManager spawns, scoped to its own interface, to answer
# `http://vaino:5720/` for anything joined to this appliance's own access
# point; iw is what confirmed live that this board's driver supports AP
# mode in the first place, and is worth keeping installed for the same
# diagnostic reason on every appliance, not just the one it was checked on.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- act led
# The green ACT LED, under listener control [PI3-LED-010].
#
# This used to hard-code the LED to track the Wi-Fi radio (rfkill1 is
# phy0) -- a real, deliberate, still-available choice ([PI3-ROCKER-020] has
# playback take Wi-Fi down deliberately, and an unreachable appliance
# otherwise just looks broken), but a hard-coded one, unreachable from the
# settings panel. It is now one of four modes a listener picks
# (`on`/`wifi`/`off`/`default`), stored in `player_settings` the same way
# the chosen speaker is, and reapplied at every boot by `vaino-led-boot`
# (staged and installed above, "bluetooth helper") -- /sys does not survive
# a reboot on its own, hence a unit rather than a one-off write.
#
# This section only ever ensures the *mechanism* exists and is enabled. It
# never forces a mode: the stored setting is the source of truth, and
# `vaino-led-boot` already defaults sensibly (solid on) when nothing has
# been chosen yet, including on a brand-new appliance with no library yet.
