# The Pi Zero 2 W has ONE radio shared between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so every
# measurement taken over ssh is taken while the thing under test is competing
# with the measurement itself. Idling the ssh session narrows that; taking the
# interface down removes it.
#
# The obvious risk is locking yourself out of a headless machine. Restoring
# Wi-Fi is therefore NOT this script's job to remember: it is armed as a
# separate detached timer before the radio goes down, so the network returns
# even if this script is killed, panics, or the shell running it dies.
#
# Idempotent: re-runnable, leaves no state behind but its log.
