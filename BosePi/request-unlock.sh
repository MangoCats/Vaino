# !! That writes through to A persistently, with NO reboot. The unlock cycle
# !! is not needed for it, and on this machine the cycle does not even leave
# !! A writable: it clears cmdline.txt's overlayroot token but NOT fstab's
# !! `ro` on A, and [IMPL-BOS-170] made the one service that would remount /

# !! bose is wireless [PI-BOS-020], NetworkManager cannot write

# The human-facing half of the lock-in escape hatch [IMPL-BOS-160]. Writes
# the C-side marker over SSH and reboots -- the boot-partition marker is for
# when SSH itself is what's broken, and is written by hand from a reader,
# not by this script.

# Asked twice, the same discipline every script here uses before undoing
# something deliberate: this requests undoing --lock-in, on the next two
# reboots, not immediately.
#
# Status: run for real against bose three times, 2026-09-06. The first two
# (before bose was --lock-in'd) only proved the already-unlocked no-op
# case, and did so against a version of vaino-unlock-check.sh that called
# `raspi-config nonint do_overlayfs 1` -- which turned out to silently do
# nothing once locked for real (see that script's own header for why). The
# third run, after the fix, proved the actual enabled-to-disabled
# transition: bose was genuinely --lock-in'd, this wrote the marker, and
# two real reboots later A was genuinely writable again. That third run
# needed recovering by hand first, since the still-broken escape hatch on
# bose at the time could not yet unlock itself -- the fixed script had to
# be deployed while A was briefly writable through a manual equivalent of
# what it now does automatically.
