# The lock-in escape hatch [IMPL-BOS-160], [REQ-HW-155]. Runs at every boot,
# very early, via vaino-unlock-check.service -- does nothing unless a marker
# exists, in which case it undoes A's overlay and reboots.
#
# Installed on A. Must be in place *before* --lock-in ever runs: once A is
# the overlay's read-only lower layer, adding anything to it needs the
# overlay disabled first -- exactly what this script exists to do, so it
# cannot be its own bootstrap.
#
# Status: found broken on its first real test against an actual lock-in
# (2026-09-06). Originally called `raspi-config nonint do_overlayfs 1`;
# that function's own disable_overlayfs() does `sed
# 's/overlayroot=tmpfs \(.*\)/.../'` -- a literal match with nothing after
# "tmpfs ". [IMPL-BOS-165]'s own recurse=0 fix (needed so B and C don't
# also get overlaid) means cmdline.txt never looks like that again, so
# raspi-config's own sed silently substitutes zero times and reports
# success anyway. Found by checking cmdline.txt directly rather than
# trusting the exit code -- the same lesson [IMPL-BOS-165] had just
# taught, applied a second time in the same evening. Rewritten to edit
# cmdline.txt directly instead of going through raspi-config for this
# specific step, and to verify the actual file afterward. Confirmed
# working against a real enabled-to-disabled transition, not only the
# already-disabled no-op case the first version was tested against.
#
# Deliberately narrow, scoped down from an earlier draft that also tried
# to restore B's fstab to rw: any edit to a file that lives on A (fstab
# included) made while A is *still* overlaid lands in the RAM upper layer
# and is lost on the very reboot this script itself triggers -- the same
# transient-write trap this whole design exists to avoid, self-inflicted.
# Restoring A alone is real and durable, because cmdline.txt lives on the
# boot partition, which is never overlaid. Reopening B is
# attended-import.sh's job, unaffected by any of this.
