# Master orchestrator for building a Vaino card for bose. Detects which
# phase comes next from observable system state and either runs it or tells
# you the one physical action needed to reach the next state -- it cannot
# skip that action, because [IMPL-BOS-100] is a fact about the hardware
# (a running system cannot repartition the card it booted from), not a
# limitation of this script.
#
# **Status: run for real, 2026-09-06** -- drove phases 3 through 5's
# `--start` to completion in one pass (found and fixed a `findmnt -q` bug
# along the way, since fixed here too). Only run once, from one specific
# starting state (bose mid-build, not yet provisioned); the *detection
# logic* for other starting states -- a fresh card not yet attached, a USB
# disk already labelled, more than one USB disk present -- is still
# reasoned from what that one build looked like, not exercised. If its
# guess about what comes next looks wrong for a state this hasn't seen yet,
# trust your own read of the state over this script's, and fix the
# detection rather than working around it quietly.
#
#     bash BosePi/build-bose-card.sh
#
# Safe to re-run at any point: it re-detects state each time rather than
# remembering where it left off, so interrupting it and running it again is
# the normal way to resume, not a special case.
#
# Deliberately stops before finalize-bose.sh --lock-in every time, no matter
# what else is ready -- that step is the point of no easy return
# [IMPL-BOS-120] and is never invoked except by a human, on purpose, having
# actually heard the thing play.
