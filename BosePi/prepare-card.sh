# Phase 1 and 2 of [BOSE002]: write a new microSD and lay out its partitions.
#
# **Runs on `bose`, against a card in a USB reader, while `bose` is booted from
# a different card** [IMPL-BOS-100]. It cannot run on the development host --
# that machine has no card slot -- and it cannot operate on the card the calling
# machine booted from, which is the constraint the whole phasing exists for.
#
# Invoke it over SSH from the development host:
#
#     scp BosePi/prepare-card.sh pi@bose:/tmp/
#     ssh pi@bose 'sudo bash /tmp/prepare-card.sh --device /dev/sda --check'
#     ssh pi@bose 'sudo bash /tmp/prepare-card.sh --device /dev/sda --go'
#
# `--check` prints what it would do and touches nothing. There is no default
# action: a script that destroys a disk must be asked twice.
#
# **Status: the partition/format sequence ran successfully against bose on
# 2026-09-06** (a 119 GB USB card, this exact firmware and e2fsprogs/f2fs-
# tools versions) -- see [BOSE003](BOSE003-build-procedure.md)'s corrections
# for what didn't match the plan on contact. The idempotent-rerun guard
# below (`ALREADY`) was added afterward and has not itself been exercised --
# it has never actually seen a card it should refuse to touch again. A
# different card size, a different Raspberry Pi OS release's partition
# layout, or different e2fsprogs/f2fs-tools versions on whatever machine
# runs this next could all change what "worked" looks like; read the
# `parted print` output this script shows before and after, not just its
# exit code.
