# power-test-manifest.sh -- the comparable state of `bose`, for the hard
# power-loss test `[PI-FS-050]`.
#
# **Read-only. It never writes to bose.** Run once before the cut and once
# after each reboot, then diff the two logs under BosePi/logs/.
#
# The output is split into two kinds of fact, because a diff is only useful
# if you know which lines are allowed to move:
#
#   INVARIANT -- must be identical across a power cut. Schema, page size,
#                user_version, integrity. Any change here IS the finding.
#   MOVES     -- boot id, uptime, pids, frame counters, and the play counts,
#                which keep growing because the appliance keeps playing. A
#                change is expected; a change in the WRONG DIRECTION (fewer
#                rows than before) is the loss being measured.
#
# `synchronous=FULL` is set on this database, so a committed transaction has
# already fsynced its WAL. Losing committed rows would therefore be a real
# finding, not the expected cost of a cut -- which is the whole reason to
# record counts beforehand rather than shrug at them afterwards.
#
# f2fs on C is mounted `errors=continue`: it will NOT remount read-only or
# panic on damage. Silence after a cut is not evidence of success, so §2
# asks the filesystem and the database explicitly instead of inferring from
# the fact that the machine came back.
#
# Deliberately does NOT use lib.sh's `run`, which dies on a failed step. A
# damaged appliance is exactly when this has to still produce a manifest, so
# `probe` below logs failure and carries on. Nothing here may abort the run.
#
# Quoting discipline, so this keeps working when edited: the remote command
# is a bash DOUBLE-quoted string (so $DB expands), and the Python inside it
# uses ONLY single quotes. SQL identifiers are [bracketed] and SQL values are
# passed as ? parameters, so no nested quote ever appears.
