# Phase 3 of [BOSE002]: turn a freshly booted Bookworm into the appliance.
#
# **Runs on the development host, over SSH** [IMPL-BOS-100], against a `bose`
# already booted from the card `prepare-card.sh` made. This is the phase that
# can be driven from here, and it is deliberately the largest one.
#
#     BosePi/provision-bose.sh [host]
#
# Idempotent by construction: every step checks before it acts, so a run that
# fails halfway is fixed by running it again rather than by unpicking it.
#
# **It stops before making anything read-only.** Step 10 of [BOSE002 §6] --
# `fstab` ro and the overlay -- is not here, because after it a mistake costs a
# card swap and the machine should have been listened to first [IMPL-BOS-120].
# (That step now lives in `finalize-bose.sh`.)
#
# **Status: ran successfully against bose twice on 2026-09-06** -- once that
# found the `blkid` PATH bug and the broken `findmnt` verification lines
# (both fixed, both re-verified on the second run), and once clean. The
# `chown $LIB_MOUNT` and `mkdir $LIB_MOUNT/mpd` lines were added *after* that
# second run, to close gaps `seed-library.sh` hit by hand -- they have not
# themselves been exercised through this script yet, only as the equivalent
# manual commands. A different Raspberry Pi OS release's package set,
# default permissions, or `mpd` version could all change what these steps
# actually need to do; read what each step reports rather than only its
# aggregate exit code.
