//! Keeping the part of the library that cannot be rebuilt `[REQ-LIB-160]`.
//!
//! The library file holds two kinds of thing, and they have opposite recovery
//! stories. The **library** — files, passages, recordings, flavor — is derived
//! from the audio on disk, and Sampo can grind it out again from nothing but
//! time. The **listening** — 37,206 plays, 3,261 preferences, the programmes
//! and their seeds — is derived from years of a person using the thing, and
//! nothing anywhere can reproduce it. Lose it and the Program Director is a
//! random shuffle with opinions it can no longer justify.
//!
//! So this copies only the second kind. That choice is what makes the backup
//! small enough to take often: a few megabytes against a library of hundreds,
//! which is the difference between a snapshot every hour and one nobody runs.
//!
//! **A copy, not a dump.** The output is a real SQLite file, openable and
//! queryable, restorable by attaching it. A schema-and-INSERTs text dump would
//! need a working player to be useful, and the moment a backup matters is the
//! moment there isn't one.
//!
//! **Rotating, not overwriting.** Corruption that goes unnoticed for a day
//! would otherwise be faithfully copied over the last good snapshot. Keeping
//! several generations means the damage has to outrun the whole set.
