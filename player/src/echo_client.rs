//!
//! `echoprobe` proved the wire can be read; this is the same reading wired to
//! an engine that can act on it. The division of labour is deliberate and
//! narrow: everything about *when* and *how far in* is decided by
//! [`crate::echo`], everything about *what plays* is decided by the engine,
//! and this module only carries messages between them and resolves a passage
//! id against the local library.
//!
//! It resolves ids because an echo node holds the same music on its own disk
//! `[GDE-ECHO-420]` -- that is the capability the whole design rests on. What
//! crosses the network is an intention, never audio.
//!
//! **A master is not trusted with this node's timing.** The schedule says when
//! a sample should sound; this node's own presentation offset decides when to
//! submit for that to happen `[GDE-ECHO-410]`, and a schedule it cannot meet
//! is declined rather than approximated.
