//! module finds and starts a co-resident Vaino on demand, from Sampo's own
//! browser; this finds and starts a co-resident Sampo the same way, from
//! Vaino's own browse page, for the one link a desktop listener curating
//! their own library might actually want to follow without opening a
//! terminal.
//!
//! Gated behind `sampo-support` exactly like `/review` and `/edit`
//! (`mod.rs`) -- Sampo is x86-desktop-only (`README.md`), and a build that
//! never runs Sampo has nothing to offer here. Not even a route exists on
//! a build without the feature, the same posture the other two take.
