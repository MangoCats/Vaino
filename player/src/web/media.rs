/// The passage's cover art `[REQ-VIS-170]`.
///
/// Read from the audio file, never fetched: playback must not depend on a live
/// external service `[REQ-NEG-100]`, and the Cover Art Archive is precisely the
/// dependency that forbids. Files without a picture are a plain 404, which is
/// what lets a skin ask unconditionally and hide the element on failure.
///
/// Served by passage rather than by album because that is the id a skin has in
/// hand, and it makes the URL stable enough to cache for a day.
/// One passage's words `[SPEC-LYR-040]`.
///
/// **An endpoint rather than a snapshot field.** The snapshot is published on
/// every tick and read by every skin; up to 5.8 KB of text in it would be sent
/// hundreds of times to say what changes once a song. A skin fetches this when
/// the passage changes, which it already notices.
///
/// Plain text, because that is what the words are — a static block, as
/// MuLibPlay showed them `[SPEC-LYR-045]`. 404 means the library has none, which
/// is the ordinary case for 72% of passages and not an error worth dressing up.
