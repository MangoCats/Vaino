// Waveform boundary editing [REQ-LIB-175], [SPEC021].
//
// Fetch the passage's current boundaries and its raw audio, decode it
// client-side, and draw a peak waveform with six draggable markers and a
// gain field over it. A drag previews on release, not on every pixel of
// motion `[SPEC021 §4]` -- decoding audio on every frame of a drag is where
// a "real-time" editor stops feeling real-time. "Save edit" posts the draft
// to `boundary_reviews`; nothing here ever touches `passages` itself
// `[SPEC-SUI-140]`.
//
// A zoomable/pannable viewport, precise numeric fields, undo, and pausing
// the main transport were added `[SPEC-SUI-217..220]` after using this
// editor against a real multi-minute file: a fixed-width canvas mapping the
// whole file to one screen made a lead-in a few pixels wide, the only way to
// grab a marker was a blind 10px guess on a bare line, there was no way back
// from a mistake, and the server's own playback kept running underneath the
// browser's preview with no way to silence it from here.
//
// Fade-in/fade-out markers and curve pickers were added `[SPEC-SUI-226]`:
// this passage's own volume envelope, independent of lead -- lead only times
// when a crossfade with a neighbour is *permitted*, and was never itself a
// gain ramp during ordinary playback, so the preview now applies
// `fade_in_ms`/`fade_out_ms` (with their own selected curve), not
// `lead_in_ms`/`lead_out_ms`, matching what real playback actually does.
