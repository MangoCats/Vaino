//! The web UI: state push over a WebSocket, controls over POST.
//!
//! The browser is a *view*. It holds no playback state of its own -- every
//! change arrives as a fresh snapshot of [`PlayerState`], and every control is
//! a command the engine may act on or ignore. That is what keeps one answer to
//! "what is playing": the engine's, published once per tick `[REQ-AUD-142]`.
//!
//! The wire format is deliberately its own type rather than a `Serialize` on
//! [`QueueEntry`]. The browser contract should change when we decide it does,
//! not as a side effect of adding a field to an internal struct -- and the
//! filesystem path is nobody's business outside the process.
//!
//! One file used to hold every route handler; now each topic has its own,
//! `pub(super)` back to here -- [`router`] is the one place that must see
//! all of them, and stays here so the actual live route table has exactly
//! one home.
