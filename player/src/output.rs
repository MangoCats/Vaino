//!
//! The device is local to the process `[REQ-AUD-150]`: remote browsers control
//! the player, they never receive audio.
//!
//! The callback runs on a real-time thread. It must not allocate, must not
//! block, and must always return promptly -- so it does exactly one thing:
//! copy from a ring buffer, and count the shortfall when there isn't enough.
//! All decoding, fading and mixing happen on ordinary threads and reach the

//! This is McRhythm's split `[DBD-PARAM-030]`: a mixer thread fills an output
//! ring, the callback drains it. The ring decouples the two so a slow decode
//! costs latency rather than a dropout.
