//! What a session needs of whatever is playing `[GDE-EXT-055]`.
//!
//! **A spike, on `investigate/external-players`.** It exists to measure the
//! cost of driving something other than the built-in engine — MPD, an
//! OpenSubsonic server — rather than to ship that. The measurement it makes is
//! the width of this file: if the trait is small, the Director is portable; if
//! it is wide, it is not.
//!
//! The seam was already here and had not been named. Measured on this tree:
//!
//! * `Session` calls **seven** methods on `Engine`, and a binary's loop three
//!   more.
//! * The **Director touches `path` nowhere** — the only occurrences under
//!   `director/` are a comment and a test fixture's DDL.
//! * Exactly **one line** turns a queue entry into audio:
//!   `PassageDecoder::open(&e.path, …)` in `engine.rs`. Every other use of
//!   `entry.path` is an error message, a filename for display, or `relink`,
//!   which is a different subsystem entirely.
//!
//! So selection is already independent of playback. What follows only writes
//! that down.
