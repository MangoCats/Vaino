//! Lyrics beside the audio, for a client that can read the music folder
//! `[SPEC-LYR-080]`.
//!
//! The companion to [`crate::lyrics_cache`], and deliberately narrower. Cantata
//! builds this path from **its own configured music folder** joined with the
//! song's path — `song.filePath(MPDConnection::self()->getDetails().dir)` — so
//! a sidecar reaches a client on another machine only where that client can
//! actually reach the music. Where it can, this works for any client that
//! shares the convention, which the cache route never will.
//!
//! **Only files holding a single passage, and the reason is not the obvious
//! one.** A capture is one file holding a dozen songs, so its sidecar could
//! only ever show all twelve at once — but that is not why it is skipped. The
//! sidecar is tried **before** the cache:
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. lyrics embedded in the tags (TagLib)
//! 2. <audiofile>.lyrics   in the client's music folder   <- this
//! 3. <audiofile>.txt
//! 4. cache/lyrics/<artist>/<title>.lyrics                <- lyrics_cache
//! 5. cache/lyrics/<artist>/<title>.txt
//! 7. online
//! ```
//!
//! So a sidecar written beside a capture would **overrule** the per-song words
//! already in the cache, and every song in that file would show all twelve
//! together. Skipping captures is what keeps the two settings complementary
//! rather than one quietly undoing the other.
//!
//! **Writes into the listener's music folder**, like [`crate::cue`] and
//! [`crate::covers`], and is off until asked for the same reason.
