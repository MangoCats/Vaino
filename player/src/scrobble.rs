//! `[SPEC-PLAY-030]` was settled.

//! **Half the passage, or four minutes, whichever comes first.** Last.fm and
//! ListenBrainz both use this threshold, so Vaino's rotation ledger agrees with

//! **Minus their minimum-length exclusion, deliberately** `[SPEC-PLAY-020]`.
//! Last.fm ignores tracks under 30 s and ListenBrainz under 5; that is an
//! anti-spam rule for a public service and does not apply to a private rotation
//! ledger. The shortest radio passage in this library is 12 s and one that
//! played in full did play.
