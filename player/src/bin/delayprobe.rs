//! Route 1 of `[GDE-ECHO-540]`: find out why the presentation-offset term
//! reads zero.
//!
//! The player records `delay=0` on every callback `[GDE-ECHO-530]`. The kernel,
//! on the same raw `hw:` device at the same moment, does not — `/proc` reports
//! a live delay swinging 2760..4396 frames with `delay + avail` pinned at 4412.
//! The quantity exists and the player cannot see it, and until that is fixed
//! Phase 1's offset column stays empty on every node and `[GDE-ECHO-290]`'s
//! eligibility rule disqualifies `bose` itself `[GDE-ECHO-535]`.
//!
//! This probe reads the same number five ways, from one process, as close to
//! the same instant as a process can manage:
//!
//!   1. `snd_pcm_status_get_delay()` — the STATUS ioctl's `delay` field. This
//!      is the one cpal uses, and therefore the one the player sees.
//!   2. `snd_pcm_delay()` — a different library call into a different kernel
//!      path for the same quantity. If (1) is zero and (2) is not, the fix is
//!      a one-line change of source.
//!   3. `snd_pcm_avail_delay()` — what cpal switched to after 0.15.3. Asking
//!      it here turns "upgrading probably fixes this" into a measurement on
//!      the hardware in question, before anyone pays for an 0.15 -> 0.18 API
//!      migration on a working audio path.
//!   4. `avail` from the same Status, with `buffer - avail` as the arithmetic
//!      cross-check that needs no delay API at all.
//!   5. `/proc/asound/.../status`, re-read per iteration — the instrument that
//!      disagreed in the first place, kept in the comparison so that the
//!      disagreement is reproduced here rather than taken on trust
//!      `[GOV-SRC-020]`.
//!
//! Then it opens the device a second time **through cpal**, which is the layer
//! actually under suspicion, and reports what `playback - callback` yields.
//! Between the two phases the question is decided: if raw ALSA reports a delay
//! and cpal reports none, the loss is in cpal's conversion and this repository
//! can fix it. If both report none while `/proc` does not, the loss is below
//! both and the answer is route 2 — read `/proc` directly, visibly, as a
//! ranked fallback `[GOV-SRC-040]`.
//!
//! **The device is exclusive.** `vaino` holds it, so this cannot run beside the
//! player: stop the service, probe, start it again. It plays true digital
//! silence, so it is inaudible even though the DAC is running.
//!
//! Usage:
//!     delayprobe [device] [seconds_per_phase]
//!     delayprobe hw:CARD=sndrpihifiberry,DEV=0 6
