//!
//! **Writes to nothing** — not `listener_play_history`, not the queue, not a
//! sticker. It reports what it *would* record, which is the whole of what stage
//! 1 is for.
//!
//! The rule is the scrobbling rule `[SPEC-MPD-090]`: a passage counts as played
//! once it has reached **half its length or four minutes, whichever comes
//! first**. Last.fm and ListenBrainz both use it, so Vaino's rotation ledger and
//! whatever scrobbler the listener already runs will agree about what happened
//! without either writing the other's data.
//!
//! **Minus their minimum-length exclusion**, deliberately. Last.fm ignores
//! tracks under 30 s and ListenBrainz under 5; that is an anti-spam rule for a
//! public service, and this is a private rotation ledger. The shortest radio
//! passage here is 12 s and one that played in full did play.
//!
//! Sampling is necessary rather than lazy. MPD's `idle` fires *after* a change,
//! when `status` already describes the next song, and `consume` retires a
//! skipped song exactly as it retires a finished one — so how far the outgoing
//! passage got is only knowable if someone was watching while it played.
