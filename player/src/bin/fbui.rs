//! A native framebuffer UI for small SPI touchscreens `[SPEC036]`.
//!
//! Phase 2 of that spec's plan: prove the pixel format and orientation
//! assumptions against real hardware before building anything else on top
//! of them. This binary does exactly one thing -- connect to `vaino`'s
//! *existing* `/ws`, the same push every browser skin already reads, and
//! draw the title/artist it carries onto whichever `/dev/fbN` the
//! `fb_ili9486` driver claims (`FbDisplay::find_panel_path`, found by name
//! rather than a fixed index after a later boot-config change moved it
//! from `fb0` to `fb1`) -- 480x320, RGB565 `[SPEC-FBUI-025]`, measured
//! against `vainoplayer3` directly, not assumed.
//!
//! Deliberately not the real `Snapshot` from `web::mod` -- that type is
//! `Serialize`-only (the server never deserializes its own push), and
//! giving it `Deserialize` too would be a change to code this design's
//! whole premise is to leave untouched `[SPEC-FBUI-015]`. `ClientSnapshot`
//! below names only the handful of fields this phase actually draws;
//! serde ignores every field it doesn't ask for, so the real `Snapshot`
//! growing a field is not a breaking change here.
//!
//! Phase 3 adds touch calibration `[SPEC-FBUI-050]`: reads the ADS7846
//! touch device's raw evdev stream directly `[SPEC-FBUI-045]` (a
//! hand-rolled 24-byte `struct input_event` parse -- the documented,
//! stable ABI on 64-bit Linux -- rather than pulling in an `evdev` crate
//! for a format this small), walks the person through three on-screen
//! targets, and solves the standard 3-point affine calibration (Vidales'
//! algorithm: the same one tslib/X11 evtouch use) rather than assuming
//! any particular rotation or axis convention. That matters here because
//! `piscreen2r`'s `rotate=90` is applied by the *display* driver; the
//! touch controller has no idea it happened, so an assumed mapping would
//! have to hardcode this panel's specific rotation. An empirical
//! screen-to-raw correspondence absorbs whatever rotation, mirroring, or
//! skew actually exists between them, without needing to know what it is.
//!
//! Phase 4 wires that calibration to an actual transport UI: play/pause,
//! skip, +-3dB volume, and tap-to-seek on the position bar, hit-tested
//! against the concrete regions `render` draws and posted to `vaino`'s
//! existing `/command/:name`, `/volume/:db`, `/seek/:ms` routes
//! `[SPEC-FBUI-015]` -- the exact three real command names `control.rs`
//! serves (`play`, `pause`, `skip`; there is deliberately no "prev" or
//! "stop" `[REQ-AUD-142]`), not assumed ones. Touch is read on its own OS
//! thread and joined with the websocket stream via `tokio::select!` in
//! `main`, rather than sharing `fbui`'s single async worker thread with a
//! blocking evdev read.
//!
//! Phase 5 fixes the reconnection gap `[SPEC036]` §7 named: every drop
//! (not just the first-ever connect) now shows `render_disconnected` and
//! resets the held snapshot, so an identical post-restart push can't be
//! mistaken by `[SPEC-FBUI-020]`'s diff check for "nothing changed."
//!
//! Phase 6 replaces `embedded-graphics`'s bundled ASCII-only fonts with
//! `u8g2-fonts`' `u8g2_font_9x15_t_symbols` -- chosen by measuring real
//! titles/artists (queried from a production `vaino.db`, not invented):
//! it covers the accented Latin that shows up constantly ("Bj\u{f6}rk",
//! "Mendon\u{e7}a"), confirmed by actually calling `render()` against it
//! rather than trusting the font name (`tests::font_coverage_matches_real_library_data`).
//! It does *not* cover the curly quotes/apostrophes and Unicode hyphens
//! that turn out to be the single most common non-ASCII character in this
//! library ("Guns N\u{2019}Roses", "The Go\u{2010}Go\u{2019}s") -- no
//! bitmap font checked carried both without jumping to `unifont`'s much
//! larger, uglier glyphs for a whole library's worth of tracks that
//! mostly don't need it. `normalize_for_display` maps that specific,
//! measured set to its plain-ASCII look-alike instead: the semantic
//! content of a title is unaffected by a curly apostrophe rendering as a
//! straight one.
//!
//! A post-Phase-7 refinement adds two pages -- Now Playing and Settings,
//! reached by a gear icon in the top-right corner of both -- rather than
//! trying to fit volume control, all 8 programmes, and per-track queue
//! editing onto one 480x320 screen at once. Now Playing gained a 2x5
//! button grid (play/pause, skip, then all 8 programmes, the currently
//! active one highlighted); Settings holds volume +/- and the upcoming
//! queue, each entry with the same sooner/remove/later actions the
//! browser skins already expose at `/queue/:qid/:action`
//! `[SPEC-FBUI-015]`. The programme buttons never send `auto`
//! (time-of-day selection) -- only ever a specific id -- matching this
//! appliance's own requirement (no realtime clock, and a truck's driving
//! hours have no relationship to a schedule tuned for home listening).
//! The position/progress redraw is throttled to once per 5 seconds
//! (`differs_ignoring_position`); every other change still redraws at
//! once.
