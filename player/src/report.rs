//! What a generation run did, said the same way every time `[PI3-API-030]`.
//!
//! Four modules write files into folders Vaino does not own — [`crate::cue`],
//! [`crate::covers`], [`crate::lyrics_cache`], [`crate::lyrics_sidecar`] — and
//! each grew its own report. The shape was identical and the **words were not**:
//! one called an untouched file `skipped`, another `kept`, a third
//! `left as they were`, all meaning the same thing, while `covers` used
//! `had_cover` for it and `skipped` for something else entirely.
//!
//! A listener reads those sentences one after another on the settings page. They
//! should differ where the runs differ and nowhere else, so the sentence is
//! built once here and each module supplies only its own nouns and reasons.
//!
//! The four modules also share a tail: once a module has decided *this*
//! candidate should be written, every one of them dry-runs, writes and reports
//! the same way. [`write_or_report`] is that tail, factored out so it can only
//! drift once instead of four times. The decision above it — *which*
//! candidates, and why the others were passed over — stays in each module,
//! because that part genuinely differs.
