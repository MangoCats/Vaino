//! The audio path supervisor `[SPEC-APS-060]`.
//!
//! One component owns the device's whole life: opening it, noticing it has
//! stopped being audible, releasing it, waiting, and opening it again. The
//! engine holds only a [`PathHandle`] -- a ring to write into and a channel to
//! ask things of -- and can therefore neither open a device, nor wait for one,
//! nor shell out to ask about one.
//!
//! **That inability is the point `[GDE-FBD-090]`.** All of this logic used to
//! live inside `Engine::tick`, and three separate times something blocking got
//! into it: a `wpctl` fork/exec, then a 700 ms settle, then nearly again. Each
//! starved the ring and presented as underruns and dropouts that looked like
//! hardware failure. The rule "nothing blocking on the tick" was written down
//! and broken anyway, because nothing enforced it. Here the enforcement is that
//! the engine has no such capability to misuse.
//!
//! On this thread, by contrast, blocking is free: it may sleep through the
//! settle, poll `wpctl`, and take as long as it likes, because nothing is
//! waiting on it to fill a buffer.
