//! Bind a transported library to this machine's paths, and verify it arrived
//! `[SPEC012]`.
//!
//! A database knows what its music *is* — `audio_md5`, the MD5 of the encoded
//! audio stream with container and tags excluded. It knows nothing true about
//! where this machine keeps it: `path` is machine scope and never survives
//! transport `[SPEC-DF-030]`. So the paths are discovered here, by asking each
//! file on disk what it is.
//!
//! This is MuLibPlay's `scanFile` `[GDE-BMK-050]`, which hashed a *file*.
//! Hashing the encoded stream instead means the binding also survives the
//! metadata writes `[SPEC-DF-060]` uses as a transport.
//!
//! **It is also the integrity check `[SPEC-RLK-140]`.** A hash that matches
//! proves the bytes arrived intact, and the walk has already paid for it. That
//! forbids the obvious optimisation: skipping files whose path already looks
//! right would make `Matched` mean "the path resolves", which is an assumption
//! wearing the costume of a result.
