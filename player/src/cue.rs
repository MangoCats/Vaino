//! Cue sheets, so a guest can name a passage inside a capture `[SPEC-MPD-056]`.
//!
//! A DAO capture carries one set of album-level tags, so MPD names every
//! passage inside it after the file — 34.1% of this library `[SPEC-MPD-052]`.
//! MPD *does* read cue sheets, and exposes each cue track as its own song with
//! its own title. Writing one beside a capture names every passage in it, for
//! every client, with no sticker support required.
//!
//! **This writes into the listener's music folder**, which is why it is off by
//! default and asked for explicitly `[REQ-VIS-205]`. Nothing else in Vaino puts
//! a file there.
//!
//! Two things measured before choosing this shape:
//!
//! * MPD applies a cue track's boundaries **as a range** and reports the right
//!   title, so `rangeid` is neither needed nor safe — it overwrites the range
//!   with offsets into the *file*.
//! * MPD **ignores `INDEX 00`**, so a track ends where the next one begins.
//!   Against radio spans that is a median 4.8 s of the next track's lead-in.
//!   The backend already ends an unhonoured span itself `[SPEC-MPD-096]`, and
//!   that machinery bounds this the same way.
