//! The playback engine: the one place that owns queue, decoders, mixer and output.
//!
//! Everything below it is a component with no opinion about time — the fader
//! knows curves, the mixer knows addition, the queue knows ordering. The engine
//! is where they meet, and deliberately the only place, so there is one pump
//! rather than one per binary.
//!
//! [`Engine::tick`] performs exactly one pump iteration and is public, so the
//! whole engine is testable without a thread, an audio device, or real time.
