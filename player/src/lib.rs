//! Vaino audio player.
//!
//! The single hard rule this crate exists to enforce: **audio is never decoded
//! whole** `[GDE-FBD-010]`. Vaino v1 called `miniaudio.decode_file()` and pulled
//! entire files into memory; this library's largest file is 244.9 minutes, which
//! is ~2.6 GB decoded at int16 and ~5.2 GB at f32 `[GDE-V1-030]`. That is not
//! slow on a 512 MB Pi Zero 2W, it is impossible.
//!
//! Everything here is built around a fixed-capacity buffer per passage
//! (~15 s, ~5.3 MB at 44.1 kHz stereo f32) `[GDE-ARC-050]`, so memory is a
//! function of how many passages are open, never of how long they are.
