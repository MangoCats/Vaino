//! Which sink is the audio *actually* reaching `[PI3-API-020]`?
//!
//! The player cannot answer this itself. It opens `default` through ALSA and
//! that is the only name it ever learns, while the routing decision happens a
//! layer further out in PipeWire. So the honest answer has to be read from
//! there, and the interface has to be willing to report `Dummy Output` --
//! PipeWire's stand-in when no hardware is present, and a sink that accepts
//! audio perfectly forever while nobody hears a thing `[PI3-WHY-010]`.
//!
//! Queried on demand rather than polled. It costs a subprocess, the settings
//! panel is the only caller, and a player that shelled out every state tick
//! would spend more effort describing its output than producing it.
