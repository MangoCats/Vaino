//! MPD as a backend the session can drive `[SPEC-BK-020]`.
//!
//! `mpd_direct` proved this as a program with its own loop. This is the same
//! behaviour turned inside out: the loop belongs to the session now, and what
//! remains is an implementation of [`Playback`] that happens to reach a server
//! instead of a sound card.
//!
//! **The rate limit lives here, not in the caller.** `tick` is called as often
//! as the engine thread spins, and MPD must be sampled every few seconds
//! `[SPEC-MPD-105]` rather than every few microseconds. A backend that made the
//! session responsible for its polling rate would have leaked its own protocol
//! upward, which is the thing the trait exists to prevent.
//!
//! **Not playing means nothing to add.** `shortfall` reports zero unless MPD is
//! playing, so `[SPEC-MPD-120]`'s activation rule needs no special case in the
//! session: the Director simply finds nothing wanted.
