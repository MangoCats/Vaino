//!
//! **The dirty marker earns its keep.** A hash alone says which commit the tree

//! commit, and reporting it as one would be a confident wrong answer of exactly
//! the kind `[PI3-API-030]` refuses.
//!
//! Absent git, or a source tarball with no repository, is not a failure. The
//! version still exists; the hash becomes `unknown`, which is honest and lets
//! the build proceed.

    // --porcelain` there reports 104 phantom modifications, so every
    // appliance build stamped `+dirty` no matter how clean the tree was. A
    // stamp that always says `+dirty` says nothing, and it said it on the one
    // machine where nobody can check by looking.

    // enough: verified live in the actual cross-compile container (git
    // 2.39.5, not the 2.51 on this Windows host, where the flag was first
    // tried and looked like it worked) that the flag changes what `git diff`
    // *prints* -- an all-CRLF file legitimately shows zero hunks -- without
    // changing which paths `--name-only`/`--name-status` lists as changed at
    // all: 275 files, unmoved, with or without it. Testing only on the
    // machine that already had `core.autocrlf=true` set globally proved
    // nothing about the one machine that doesn't -- the exact mistake this
    // comment already warns about, made once fixing it.
    //
    // `-c core.autocrlf=true`, passed to this one invocation rather than set
    // globally in either the container or the mounted repository's own
    // config, fixes it for real: confirmed live back to 0 in the same
    // container. This makes the invocation behave the same way regardless of
    // whatever autocrlf this or any future build environment happens to
    // have configured for itself, rather than depending on it.
