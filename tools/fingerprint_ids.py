"""Check every recording MBID against the audio itself `[REQ-LIB-165]`.

Every recording id in this library arrived the same way -- `source` on all
16,157 rows of `passage_recordings` reads `inherited:mulib` -- so they are all
as good, or as bad, as one migration. `verify_ids.py` compared them against the
file's own tags and found 2.8% plainly wrong and a third disagreeing on title.
But tags cannot settle it: the ids may well have been *derived* from the tags,
in which case agreement proves only that a copy matches its original.

A fingerprint owes nothing to either. Chromaprint reduces the audio to a
summary of how it actually sounds, AcoustID maps that to the recordings other
people have identified the same sound as, and neither has ever seen this
library's metadata. That is genuinely independent evidence, and it is the only
kind available here.

Verdicts, deliberately asymmetric:

  confirmed     the stored id is among the recordings AcoustID returns
  contradicted  AcoustID is confident, and the stored id is not among them
  inconclusive  a match too weak to argue either way
  unmatched     AcoustID does not know this audio; this says nothing
  unreadable    the file would not decode

Confirmation is lenient and contradiction is strict, because the two errors are
not equally costly: a wrongly confirmed id stays as wrong as it already was,
while a wrongly contradicted id sends a person to review something that was
fine. The review queue is only useful if nearly everything in it deserves to be
there.

The library is opened **read-only** and the findings are written to a sidecar
database beside it. Sampo's fetches hold the library's write lock for a minute
at a time, and a two-hour pass that has to queue behind them would spend most of
its life waiting; a pass that cannot write to the library also cannot damage it.
`--merge` folds the sidecar in once the library is quiet.
