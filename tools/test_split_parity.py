"""A migrated script must give the same answer split as it does whole.

This is how the local split's remaining migration is verified, and it is
deliberately not a unit test: it runs each script the way a person runs it,
against a real split pair and against the real single-file database the
pair was made from, and compares what comes out. Same answer, or the
migration is wrong.

It exists because the first migrated script *looked* fine and was not.
`export_flags.py` returned "nothing flagged there yet" against a split pair
holding thirteen flags -- its `sqlite_master` existence check answers only
for `main`, decided the table was absent, and reported an empty list as a
fact. Nothing raised, nothing logged. A unit test on the helper would not
have caught it; running the script and comparing did.

Read-only scripts only. Anything that writes is verified by other means --
its own tests, or a rehearsal against a copy -- because running it twice
against two databases would be two different sets of side effects.

    python tools/test_split_parity.py --pair DIR --whole vaino.db

`--pair` is a directory holding `library.db` and `listener.db`, as
`split_database.py --commit` produces. Build one from the database under
test so the two sides genuinely hold the same rows:

    python tools/split_database.py vaino.db \\
        --library-out pair/library.db --listener-out pair/listener.db --commit
