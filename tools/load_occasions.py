"""Load MuLibPlay's four seasonal curves as data `[SPEC-DIR-134]`.

MuLibPlay hardcoded `[C]`, `[W]`, `[S]` and `[K]` into a `switch`, which is why
it had exactly four. Vaino reads curves from `listener_occasions` and
`listener_occasion_points`, so these are rows, and a fifth occasion needs no
code `[SPEC-DIR-130]`.

The values below are transcribed from `occasionWeight()` in the inherited
`musicdirector.cpp`. The library already carries the characteristic values —
41 christmasy recordings, 140 for_children, and a handful of wintry/summery —
inherited from six years of tagging, so loading the curves is what makes that
tagging act again.

Each row also carries the name the preference panel offers it under
`[SPEC-PREF-080]`. The label tracks the characteristic rather than departing
from it -- "Christmas" for `user.christmas` -- so that a person reading the
panel and a person reading `listener_occasions` are looking at the same word.
The column exists because the two *can* differ ("Children's" for
`user.childrens`), not because they should.

Usage:
  python tools/load_occasions.py <vaino.db> [--write] [--kids WEIGHT]
                                            [--profanity WEIGHT] [--spiritual WEIGHT]
                                            [--library library.db]

`--library` is for a split installation `[IMPL-DBSPLIT-025]`: the curves are
written to the listener database given first, while the "reach" count that
reports how many passages each occasion touches is read from the catalogue.
Omitted, the one database given is both.

# it. It arrives here as a one-point curve at exactly 1.0, which is that same
# behaviour stated rather than inherited by accident: recorded, editable, and
# changing nothing about selection until someone chooses a number.
# `--profanity 0.25` is then the whole of "play the explicit ones a quarter as
# often" -- no code, which is the test `[SPEC-DIR-134]` sets for a curve being
# data.
#
# `migrate_mulib.py` lists it in `DEAD_FIELDS`, so nothing is inherited for it
# today -- but that listing is wrong about this field, and was until audited on
# 2026-09-10: 69 MuLibPlay tracks carry a real non-zero profanity value. Until
# those are backfilled the slider starts from nothing on every recording

# one-point curve at 1.0, neutral until someone chooses otherwise.
#
# Every existing recording reads 0.0 for it, and does so by carrying **no row
# at all** rather than 8,116 explicit zeros `[SPEC-PREF-083]`. An absent value
# already reads as 0.0 everywhere it is consulted -- `occasion.rs`'s multiplier
# is `1 + value x (curve - 1)`, so 0.0 ignores the curve exactly -- and writing
# the zeros would cost a row per recording while destroying the one distinction
# the panel is built on: "nobody has an opinion" against "somebody said no".
