"""Stage 4 of [GDE-WRK-125]: fill `works` and `recording_works` from the crawl.

`fetch_works.py` caches MusicBrainz responses and writes nothing to the
catalogue, deliberately `[GDE-WRK-110]`. This is the other half: read that
cache, and record which Works each recording performs.

**Identity, not relation.** No `recording_relations` rows are written and no
pairwise closure is computed. The Director blocks on a shared work MBID the
same way it already blocks on a shared recording MBID `[GDE-WRK-037]`, so the
only thing the catalogue has to carry is the membership.

Every `performance` relation is kept, whatever its attributes -- `live`,
`cover`, `partial`, `instrumental`, `medley` are all recorded and none is
read `[GDE-WRK-052]`. A recording performing several works gets a row for each
`[GDE-WRK-070]`.
