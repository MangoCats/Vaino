"""Repair `files.duration_ms` from the decoded length `[REQ-LIB-145]`.

`[SPEC-SC-030]` specifies `duration_ms` as **decoded, not header-claimed**, and
the migrated library violates it: 29.2% of files differ from their decoded
length by more than 5 s, and one overstates by 38.4 minutes `[GDE-FEX-106]`.

Not cosmetic. Segmentation used an inflated value to invent a **phantom
passage** in a tail that does not exist, and the player uses `duration_ms` for
lead-out timing. So this repairs the passages too:

  * `files.duration_ms`  → the decoded value, where it disagrees
  * `passages.end_ms`    → clamped to the real end, where it overruns
  * `lowlevel_cache`     → the orphaned row for the old span deleted, not
                            left pointing at audio nothing plays anymore
  * phantom passages     → reported; deleted only on explicit request

Repair only where it disagrees. Rewriting a correct value is churn, and the
`updated` counts below are the evidence of what was actually wrong.

**Second pass, 2026-08-30 — the first version of this tool could not see any
of this.** It probed with `ffprobe -show_entries format=duration`, the exact
metadata-estimate method that produces a wrong answer for a VBR file with no
valid Xing/Info header in the first place. Checked directly against the real
library: of 1,695 files wrong against an actual decode, ffprobe's own
re-check agreed with the (wrong) stored value in all 1,695 -- a tool that
compares a number against the method that generated it can never disagree
with it. Now uses `audio_duration.probe_duration_ms`, which actually decodes.
