"""Clear listener references to passages that no longer exist.

**The application-level replacement for a database-level cascade that a
split silently switches off** -- `[IMPL009 §7.7]`'s named prerequisite for
splitting the *local* database specifically.

Three listener-side columns reference `passages` with `ON DELETE SET NULL`:

    listener_play_history.passage_id   -- six years of it
    selection_decisions.passage_id
    player_state.passage_id            -- the resume point

SQLite does not enforce a FOREIGN KEY across two ATTACHed databases. In one
file, deleting a passage NULLs these automatically; in two files the
constraint stops firing **silently**, because a query across an attach
boundary does not error, it just gets no enforcement. So every one of those
columns would start accumulating ids pointing at passages that no longer
exist, and `[SPEC-SC-095]`'s own reason for keeping them denormalised --
"six years of history must survive a rescan that renumbers passages" --
would be the thing broken.

`[IMPL009 §7.7]` names two of the three. `player_state.passage_id` is the
third, found by querying `sqlite_master` on the real local database rather
than reading the source -- the same method that found the other two, and
the same lesson: the deployed schema and the Rust constants are not the
same thing.

**This is correct before a split as well as after**, which is why it can be
wired in ahead of one. In a single file the cascade has already NULLed
everything by the time this runs and it clears nothing; in a split pair,
opened so that both halves are visible on one connection, it does the work
the cascade no longer can. The same call, either shape.

Usage, as a library -- from any tool that deletes or renumbers passages:

    import passage_orphans
    passage_orphans.clear(conn)          # after the delete, before commit

Usage, as a command -- to sweep a database that was already damaged:

    python tools/passage_orphans.py <listener.db> [--library library.db] [--commit]
