"""Generate the click track for an acoustic drift measurement.

    tools/click_emit.py out.wav [minutes] [rate] [channels]

Play it on the node under test and record it on a node with a microphone, then
read the recording with `tools/click_analyze.py`. What comes back is the
emitter's sample rate minus the recorder's, in ppm -- a *relative* figure, which
is the honest thing an acoustic measurement can produce `[GDE-ECHO-460]`.

Why this works at all: the measurement reads the *spacing* between clicks, not
their absolute arrival. Speaker-to-microphone distance adds the same constant
to every click and cancels in the differencing; a sample-rate error does not
cancel, because it scales the spacing. So the geometry can be sloppy -- put the
speaker near the microphone and do not measure the distance -- while the
quantity of interest survives.

**Match the target's native rate.** The default is 44100 because that is what
`bose` runs and what the library is. If any resampler stands between this file
and the DAC -- PipeWire, `plug:`, a mismatched rate -- it will impose its own
clock and the measurement becomes a reading of the resampler, which is exactly
how `vainopi`'s first figure came out as a meaningless +0.0073 ppm
`[LOG-DRIFT-058]`. Play it with `aplay -D hw:...` on the raw device, or accept
that the number describes the software chain rather than the hardware.

Each click is a short Hann-windowed chirp rather than an impulse. A chirp
survives room reverberation with a sharper correlation peak than a click of the
same energy, and its bandwidth keeps it clear of whatever hum and traffic noise
the room contributes.
