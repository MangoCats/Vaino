Environment first, then a gitignored file. The environment wins so a run can
override without editing anything, and the file exists so an unattended run --
which is what these all are -- does not need one exported by hand each time.

Nothing here ever prints a key. A credential that reaches a log has reached
everywhere the log goes, and the two-hour runs these serve are the kind whose
output gets pasted into a bug report.
