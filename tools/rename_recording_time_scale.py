"""Rename `listener_settings.track_time_scale` to `recording_time_scale`
`[SPEC-VOC-010]`.

The column was always the recording-side half of `[REQ-PD-118]`'s two master
time scales -- "one for artists, one for recordings" -- never a per-track
concept. `player/src/director/frequency.rs`'s own `Weighing`/`Policy` fields
were renamed the same way; this closes the one place that rename could not
reach on its own, because a Rust identifier and a SQL column are not the
same edit.

`ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN` (SQLite 3.25.0+, 2018) does this in place:
the stored value, the `CHECK` constraint, and every other column are
untouched, and nothing reads or writes through the old name afterward --
`sql/schema.sql` and `player/src/director/library.rs` were updated in the
same change that added this tool. Idempotent: a database already migrated,
or one with no `listener_settings` row at all (never tuned), is a no-op
either way, not an error.

Usage:
  python tools/rename_recording_time_scale.py <vaino.db> [--write]
