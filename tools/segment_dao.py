"""Segment a disc-at-once capture into its tracks `[SPEC-SA-070]`, `[SPEC024]`.

A DAO file is a whole side or disc in one recording. Ingested whole it becomes
one 160-minute "track": useless for rotation, and its flavor is the average of
forty songs, which describes none of them.

Inherited from McRhythm's `[AFS-SIL-010..040]`, with one correction its
document does not make. McRhythm places a boundary "at the midpoint of each
silent period". The 188 files already segmented in this library do not do
that -- their passages leave the silence OUT, ending where the music ends and
resuming where the next begins. A passage is the audible content, and the gap
between two of them is the gap between two songs. Matching the existing
convention is what makes the result comparable with 2,676 hand-checked
boundaries rather than merely plausible.

    python tools/segment_dao.py <db> --validate [--limit N]                against known files
    python tools/segment_dao.py <db> --file <path>                        propose, print only
    python tools/segment_dao.py <db> --file <path> --expect N              count-driven, grid only
    python tools/segment_dao.py <db> --file <path> --expect 245,198,312    full cascade, print only
    python tools/segment_dao.py <db> --file <path> --commit                propose, identify, write
    python tools/segment_dao.py <db> --file <path> --expect 245,198,312 --commit --json

`--commit` requires the file to already be in the library -- run
`tools/ingest_folder.py` on its folder first `[SPEC-SA-070]`, `[SPEC-SA-110]`.
It replaces that whole-file placeholder with one identified `radio`/`album`
pair per track, the same album/radio duality `ingest_folder.py` now writes
by default for a single-track file `[GDE-BMK-030]`. Without `--expect`, both
the preview and `--commit` need an AcoustID key (`secrets/acoustid.key` or
`ACOUSTID_KEY`) -- `propose()`'s own threshold choice is identification
rate, so even looking has to look things up.

`--expect` as a bare count runs Stage 2's grid search alone -- today's
behaviour, unchanged. As a comma-separated list of expected per-track
durations in seconds, it drives the full cascade `[SPEC-SA-115..121]`: grid
search, then DP assembly or extra-track merging if it over-segmented, or an
RMS quiet-spot fallback if silence detection found nothing usable at all.
Stage 3/4 need durations to score against, not only a count, so a bare
integer skips them rather than guessing at values it was not given
`[GOV-SRC-040]`.

    Replaces rather than adds to what is already there: the ordinary

    whole-file `radio`/`album` pair, a deliberate one-track-per-file
    placeholder for exactly this shape of file, not a rival segmentation
    worth keeping once a real one exists.

    Each span is identified independently, the same convention this
    library's own 133-of-136 already-segmented tracks were produced under: a
    confident AcoustID match gets the real MusicBrainz recording (and every
    credited artist); anything else gets `local:audio:<md5>:<start_ms>`, the
    same placeholder shape `local:audio:<md5>` alone already means for a
    single-track file, extended with the one thing that makes it unique
    inside a DAO capture -- where in the file it starts.

    `decision` carries which stage resolved it, at what confidence, and
    what the grid tried and rejected -- `boundary_src` names the algorithm
    and version only `[SPEC-SA-122]`; the parameters that produced this
    particular result go to `ingest_decisions` instead `[SPEC-SA-123]`,
