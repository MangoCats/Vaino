"""Tests for `jobs.py`'s `_remote_push` wiring `[SPEC-DF-120]`.

Runs the real `Runner` and its real background worker thread. `export` and
`snapshot` are faked -- the former would otherwise read the real library
(fine, but not the point of this test), the latter would otherwise shell out
to `ssh`; `send`/`apply-remote` are faked the same way `test_jobs_remote_pull
.py` already fakes the pull side's own ssh-touching stage. `compare`
(`apply_changes.py`) runs for real, against a real tiny snapshot db a fake
`remote_snapshot.py` stage produced -- what is under test here is
specifically that `remote_snapshot.py` replaced the old `scp` full-copy
`fetch` stage without changing anything about the stages around it.
