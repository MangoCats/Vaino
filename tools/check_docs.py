Documentation governance checks [GOV-DOC-010..040].

Enforces mechanically what would otherwise depend on discipline. Written after
an audit found that the hazards recorded in docs/inherited/README.md were partly
mis-stated: [INH-HAZ-020] claimed inherited and Vaino identifier tags did not
collide, and measurement found seven exact collisions. Claims about a document
set should be checked by a program, not asserted by a person.

Checks:
  1. Every file under docs/inherited/ carries the MCR- prefix (or is source code).
  2. No Vaino document defines a tag whose prefix is reserved to inherited material.
  3. No exact tag collision between Vaino documents and inherited documents.
  4. Every relative markdown link resolves (code spans excluded).
  5. Vaino documents: 100-250 line target, 300-line hard limit [GOV-DOC-010]; warn only.
  6. Every cited tag is defined somewhere; no tag is defined twice.
  7. Every doc-cited player/tools/sql/docs/build/VainoPi/BosePi/sendspin path
     exists in the tree [GOV-DOC-040]; warn only.

Usage:
