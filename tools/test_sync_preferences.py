"""Tests for `sync_preferences.py`'s decision logic `[SPEC030]`.

`decide()` and `patch_sql_for()` are pure -- no database, no ssh call --
which is exactly what's checked here, the same discipline
`ingest_cd.py`/`segment_dao.py`'s own tests already use. `read_local_manifest`/
`apply_local` get one small in-memory-db round trip each, since that part
is genuinely I/O.
