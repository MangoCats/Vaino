"""Give an old radio-only passage the album twin it never got `[SPEC-SA-110]`,
`[GDE-BMK-030]`.

Every recording-in-file span is meant to carry two passages, one per `kind`
-- the single best schema idea in the lineage, and the migrated MuLibPlay
data has it: 8,079 `album` against 8,078 `radio`, essentially 1:1. Everything
Vaino's own newer ingest paths wrote does not: 116 `ingest:whole-file` and
136 `segment:silence-*+acoustid` passages, all `radio`, none `album` -- found
live 2026-08-31 starting from one flagged track with no album cut at all.

The backfill is mechanical, not a re-detection. `analyze_amplitude.py` only
ever writes `lead_in_ms`/`lead_out_ms` on a `kind='radio'` row `[SPEC-SUI-*]`;
it never touches `start_ms`/`end_ms`. So for every one of these newer
passages the hard boundary the album cut needs is already sitting right
there on its radio sibling -- copied, not recomputed. An album cut's own
segue points equal its own hard boundaries `[GDE-BMK-030]`: `lead_in_ms=0`,
`lead_out_ms=0`, `gain_db=0.0`, permanently, never NULL the way a radio cut
awaiting analysis is.

Idempotent and safe to re-run: a `(file_id, kind, start_ms, end_ms)` pair
already present is left alone, matching `passages_span`'s own unique index.

    Scoped to `ingest:whole-file` and `segment:silence-*` on purpose, not

    `end_ms` identical between a passage's own kinds (`analyze_amplitude.py`
    only ever writes `lead_in_ms`/`lead_out_ms`, never the span). The
    migrated `inherited:mulib` data does not share that property -- its own
    radio cut is independently trimmed at the row level, so its `start_ms`
    can legitimately differ from its album twin's by design, not by a gap.
    Matching on exact span there would misread an already-paired row as
    missing one and duplicate it. `inherited:mulib` is already ~1:1 paired
