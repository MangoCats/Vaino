"""Recover MuLibPlay's profanity ratings, which `migrate_mulib.py` dropped.

`migrate_mulib.py` lists `profanity` in `DEAD_FIELDS`, justified as "NULL for
all 8,116 rows across six years, or under 10 rows" and citing `[GDE-BMK-040]`.
That finding covers nine columns and profanity is not one of them: 2,529
MuLibPlay tracks carry a non-NULL value and **69 carry a real non-zero one**,
between 0.001 and 0.874. Audited 2026-09-10; this is the only MuLibPlay
listener data that migration actually loses `[SPEC-PREF-082]`.

Every one of the 69 carries an `mbidRecording`, and every one of those
resolves in the Vaino catalogue, so this is a join and not a re-derivation --
no audio decode, no fingerprinting, no `sig` bridge.

**The 2,460 tracks whose profanity is exactly 0.0 are deliberately not
written** `[SPEC-PREF-083]`. An absent value already reads as 0.0 everywhere
it is consulted -- the occasion multiplier is `1 + value * (curve - 1)`, so
0.0 ignores the curve exactly -- and MuLibPlay initialised the column rather
than 2,460 people deciding 2,460 songs were clean. Writing them would cost a
row per track (4,920 with complements) to change nothing, while destroying
the distinction the preference panel is built on: "nobody has an opinion"
against "somebody said no".

Rows land in `flavor` with `source='inherited:mulib'`, positive and
complement, exactly as the same migration wrote the four occasion tags
beside them -- **not** in `listener_characteristics`, which asserts "this
listener set this by hand" and a six-year-old migrated value is not that.

Idempotent: the source is immutable and the write is `INSERT OR REPLACE`, so
re-running lands the same rows.

Usage:
  python tools/backfill_profanity.py <vaino.db> [--mulib ../MuLibPlay/mulib.db]
                                     [--library library.db] [--commit]
  python tools/backfill_profanity.py <vaino.db> --sql-out patch.sql

`--library` is for a split installation `[IMPL-DBSPLIT-025]`: `flavor` lives
on the catalogue side, so that is the file written. Omitted, the one database
given is both.

`--sql-out` writes the patch instead of applying it, for a catalogue this
machine cannot open -- the appliance's, which the player attaches read-only
and which is reached by shipping SQL and restarting the service
`[PI5-LIB-010]`, exactly as `sync_preferences.py` reaches its own remote.
Every statement carries its own `WHERE EXISTS` guard against `recordings`,
so the patch is checked against whichever catalogue actually applies it
rather than against this one.
