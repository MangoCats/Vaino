"""Suggest a MusicBrainz release for a folder of already-split files
`[SPEC-SUI-215]`.

Not a reproduction of the inherited McRhythm album-matcher (`MCR-SPEC033`,
marked PROVISIONAL/P4 in `SPEC007` §6) -- that solves a harder, different
problem: finding cut points inside one continuous DAO-rip file, with no
identifiers at all. A folder like this one is already split one file per
track, and each file's own tags already carry a title, an artist, often a
track number. Matching a short list of already-separate files against a
release's own short tracklist needs none of the boundary-detection/DP-
assembly machinery that problem does -- just fuzzy title/duration matching
between two lists of ~10-20 items, which is what this does.

Two independent modes, rehearse-by-default like every other tool here:

**Discovery** -- read and cache only, never touches `passage_recordings`:

    python tools/suggest_release.py data/vaino_new.db "C:/Music/Foghat/The Best of Foghat" --json

Guesses `artist`/`album` from the folder's own file tags (majority vote) when
`--query` isn't given, searches MusicBrainz's release search, fetches full
track/recording detail for the top few candidates, scores each by how well
its tracklist lines up with the folder's actual files, and reports all of it
-- caching every release/track pulled in `releases`/`release_recordings`,
exactly the shape `fetch_releases.py`/`choose_release.py` already read and
write, so nothing downstream needs to know which tool populated them.

**Accept** -- the write half, rehearse-by-default:

    python tools/suggest_release.py data/vaino_new.db "C:/Music/Foghat/The Best of Foghat" \\
        --accept e4d469ff-3633-4e16-8f49-03c48e37c5fb --commit --json

Re-derives the same per-file matches against that one release (from cache,
no new MusicBrainz calls needed unless it was never fetched) and, for each
confidently-matched file's passage, assigns the matched recording -- the
same shape `apply_changes.py`'s `apply_id_review` already writes -- and
records one `ingest_decisions` row per affected passage, the exact field
shape `choose_release.py` already established (`stage`, `outcome`=chosen id,
`confidence`=score, JSON `detail`), so `profile.html`'s existing "Ingest
decisions" table renders it with no changes of its own. Unmatched files are
left untouched and named, never guessed at.

Also clears any `listener_flags` row a reassigned passage's old or new
recording id, or the passage itself, could plausibly have been flagged
under `[SPEC-DF-112]` -- the identical `clear_flags_for()` `apply_changes.py`
already uses for the sync path, reused rather than reimplemented. Without
this, a flag set against the passage's *pre-accept* recording id survives
the reassignment pointing at an id nothing resolves to any more, and reads
on `/flags` as "no longer resolvable" -- indistinguishable from a passage
that vanished, when what actually happened is the opposite: the flag was
answered.
