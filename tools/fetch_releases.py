"""Sampo S3, release half: fill `releases` and `release_recordings` [SPEC-SA-030].

Vaino knows 7,912 recordings and not one release, which is why every album name
it shows comes from a file's own ID3 tag rather than from MusicBrainz. A
Recording is a piece of recorded audio; a Release is the published product, and
*its* title is what an album is called. The link between them is many-to-many,
so it is a join table and not a column, and filling it is ingest work -- Sampo's
job, never the player's [REQ-VIS-170].

Being a good citizen of a free service is most of the design here:

  * one request per second, which is MusicBrainz's published limit;
  * a real User-Agent with a contact address, which they ask for and enforce;
  * resumable, so an interrupted run costs only what it had not yet fetched;
  * every response cached, so a re-run after a schema change asks nothing twice.

At one request per second the full library is a little over two hours. It is
meant to be left running, and it can be stopped at any point with Ctrl-C.
