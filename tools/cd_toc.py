"""Reading a disc-at-once rip's own table of contents [SPEC-RIP-030..035].

Pure parsing only -- no ffmpeg, no network, no database. `tools/ingest_cd.py`
is the orchestrator that calls into this; kept separate because `[SPEC-RIP-030]`
itself calls for the frame-conversion math to be "tested on its own rather
than folded into a larger one, the same lesson McRhythm's own tick-based
timing already cost this project's lineage once."

Two source formats, one output shape (`DiscToc`) -- the "thin adapter
boundary" `[SPEC-RIP-024]` describes, so nothing downstream of parsing cares
which tool actually ripped the disc:

  * EAC's `.cue` + extraction `.log`, the person-assisted Windows path.
  * cdrdao's `.toc`, the Linux path (parsing only in this pass -- Sampo does
    not yet drive `cdrdao` itself; see `SPEC025 §2`'s Open-note and
    ROADMAP.md).

**The MusicBrainz/CDDB offset convention, verified against real data, not
assumed.** Both algorithms below measure a track's start in CD frames
(1/75 s) from a point 150 frames (2 seconds) *before* track 1's own audio --
the Red Book lead-in convention. Verified 2026-09-04 two ways against the
real 14-track disc ripped during this session's hardware test
(`C:\\tmp\\eac-test\\`, outside the repo):

  1. `cddb_disc_id()` against EAC's own `REM DISCID B90E090E` line in its
     `.cue` -- computed from this module reproduces `B90E090E` exactly,
     using EAC's reported start sectors + 150.
  2. `musicbrainz_disc_id()` against a live `GET /ws/2/discid/<id>` call --
     the computed id matched MusicBrainz's own `offsets` array exactly and
     resolved the disc: "The Essential Cyndi Lauper" (US, 2003), three
     country editions returned for the one physical disc -- itself a real
     example of `[SPEC-RIP-069]`'s down-select case, and evidence that even
     a exact-offset match can still return more than one release.
