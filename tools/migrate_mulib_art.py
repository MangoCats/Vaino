"""Bring MuLibPlay's hand-curated album art into Vaino's `cover_art` table
`[REQ-VIS-170]` `[GDE-PHS-010]`.

`migrate_mulib.py` moved six years of MuLibPlay history into Vaino -- files,
recordings, passages, play history, preferences -- but never `albums.coverArt`
/`backCover`. Everything since has come from `fetch_cover_art.py`'s Cover Art
Archive pass, which only asks about a narrow gap (releases behind a file with
no embedded picture and no `folder.jpg`) and only found something for about
half of what it asked. MuLibPlay's own art was never in the running.

The mapping turns out to be clean, not fuzzy: every one of MuLibPlay's 673
art-bearing albums (of 675) carries a MusicBrainz release `mbid`, and that
`mbid` is exactly Vaino's `cover_art.release_mbid`. No title/artist matching
needed -- this is a straight key join.

**MuLibPlay wins where both have art**, per-side rather than per-row: it is
six years of a person choosing a picture, against an archive script's first
hit. An existing archive image is kept only for the side MuLibPlay has
nothing for (2 albums have no front at all; 116 have no back). Source becomes
`inherited:mulib` for any row this touches -- the same tag `migrate_mulib.py`
uses for the rest of MuLibPlay's data -- which loses per-side provenance on a
mixed row, but the table only ever tracked one source per row regardless of
how many sides it covers.

This alone does not make the art appear everywhere MuLibPlay showed it: the
player looks up `cover_art` through the release Sampo *chose* for a
recording, and MuLibPlay's pick is Sampo's chosen release for only 164 of
these 673 -- a different pressing, usually. `player/src/db.rs::stored_art`
now falls back to any release known to carry the same recording when the
chosen one has no art (matching what `player/src/covers.rs` already did for
the MPD-facing cover file), which is what turns this from 164 passages worth
of art into roughly 15,600 of the library's 16,400.

Usage:
    python tools/migrate_mulib_art.py --mulib mulib.db data/vaino_new.db
    python tools/migrate_mulib_art.py --mulib mulib.db --dry-run /srv/library/vaino.db
