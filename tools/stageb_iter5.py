"""
[GDE-FEX-100] Stage B iteration 5: complete the factorial.

Iteration 4 fit dedicated MLPs for the seven characteristics whose iteration-3
winner was the SHARED MLP -- and the dedicated MLP won 7 out of 7, sometimes by a
lot (mood_happy 0.147 -> 0.076).

That result implicates the rest of the table. The ten characteristics where GBM
won in iteration 3 were only ever compared against the SHARED MLP; a dedicated
MLP was never fit for them either. Only `gender` and `genre_tzanetakis` currently
have all three candidate families measured -- and `gender` flipped to the
dedicated MLP once it was tried.

This run fits dedicated MLPs for the remaining characteristics so that every cell
of the comparison finally comes from the same candidate set [LOG-I3-030].
