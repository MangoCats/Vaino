"""Sampo S3, third pass: the track listing of each chosen release.

The browse endpoint that finds candidate releases returns `media` without the
tracks inside it, so `position` and `track_length_ms` come back empty. Both
matter: position is what lets an album be listed in the order it was recorded
onto the record rather than alphabetically `[REQ-VIS-190]`, and it should come
from MusicBrainz rather than from whatever the person who ripped the disc typed
into a tag.

Fetching it per *candidate* would be ruinous -- one recording here has 86 of
them. Fetching it per **chosen** release is cheap, because a chosen release
covers every one of its tracks at once: an album of twelve songs is one request,
not twelve. Run after `choose_release.py`.
