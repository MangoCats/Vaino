"""Build the derived-data payload that travels between installations `[SPEC014]`.

`[SPEC-DF-065]` promises "one serializer, one parser, one schema version" across
all three transports. This is that serializer -- the only one. Stage 4's bundle
exporter imports it rather than growing a second copy `[GDE-FBD-040]`, and the
embedded-tag and sidecar transports `[SPEC-DF-060]` emit the same object into a
different envelope.

What travels is decided by scope, not by convenience `[SPEC-DF-040]`:

  * `encodings[]`  bind by `audio_md5` -- this exact rip. Passages, boundaries,
                   trim points and gain are meaningless against another encode.
  * `recordings[]` bind by `recording_mbid` -- this music, any encoding. Flavor,
                   titles, artists and releases are valid for anyone holding it.

They are separate arrays because a recording may be referenced by several
encodings, which is the schema's own shape and not a serialisation choice.

**What is deliberately absent is most of the database.** Measured 2026-08-20 on
the 1,072 MB library: `musicbrainz_cache` is 547 MB and `lowlevel_cache` 202 MB
-- 73% of the file with `identification_cache` -- and a Vaino has no use for any
of it. The caches exist so Sampo need not re-query a rate-limited service or
re-decode audio; a player neither queries nor decodes. Class D never travels at
all `[SPEC-DF-055]`, and machine scope -- `path`, `mtime`, `size_bytes` -- is
supplied by the receiver from the file it actually has `[SPEC-DF-030]`.
