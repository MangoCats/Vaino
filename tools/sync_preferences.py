"""Sync `listener_preferences` between two installations `[SPEC030]`.

`SPEC029` gave a listener a way to edit an artist's or a recording's own
`rotation`/`recovery`/`restraint` locally. This is what happens once two
installations -- a desktop and `vainopi`, say -- have each done that
independently: last-write-wins by `updated_at`, not the three-way baseline
merge `apply_changes.py` uses for review decisions. There is no baseline
to merge against here -- `listener_preferences` carries only ever "the
current tuning," so the side with the newer `updated_at` for a given
`(subject_kind, subject_id)` simply wins, and its row is copied to the
other side.

**A subject syncs only if it is a real artist/recording on *both* sides.**
Tuned on only one side but the *other* side has never heard of that
artist/recording at all -- skipped, not pushed onto a library it does not
belong to.

**No database copy.** One `ssh ... sqlite3 -json ...` round trip
(`remote_peek.run_remote_sql`) reads the whole remote table -- the same
economy `remote_flags.py` already established for `listener_flags`, a
table of the same small scale (a row exists only once a subject has
actually been tuned; MuLibPlay's own migrated data was 36% of tracks,
`[GDE-BMK-020]`, so this was never going to be a large table). What
"transfer only the changed preferences" actually costs is on the *write*
side: only the rows that differ are ever patched, in either direction.

    python tools/sync_preferences.py <local_db> user@host:/path/to/vaino.db
    python tools/sync_preferences.py <local_db> user@host:/path/to/vaino.db --commit
    python tools/sync_preferences.py <local_db> user@host:/path/to/vaino.db --commit --json

A **split** remote needs `--remote-library /path/to/library.db` as well: the
existence check in `[SPEC-PREF-110]` reads `artists`/`recordings`, which do
not live in the listener database this otherwise talks to `[SPEC-PREF-155]`.
Without it every one-sided subject is filed "missing on the other side" and
nothing syncs at all.

Rehearse by default: without `--commit`, nothing is written on either
side -- only counts are reported. The remote write, when there is one,
follows the identical `[PI5-LIB-010]` recipe `jobs.py::_remote_push` and
`push_file_tags.py` already use: stop the service, apply the patch,
restart it -- issued only when there is actually something to write.
The local write is advisory-only about the player, the same posture
`apply_changes.py` already takes for a local db; a best-effort
`POST /library/reload` afterward lets an already-running local Vaino pick
the change up without needing a restart.
