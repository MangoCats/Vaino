"""Build a tiny local snapshot of exactly what a `changes.json` needs to
compare against on a remote installation, without copying its database
`[SPEC-DF-120]`.

`remote-push`'s own read was measured at ~1.16 GB / over an hour
`[SPEC-DF-114]` -- the identical cost `[SPEC-DF-119]` already eliminated for
`remote-pull`, left standing here because "converting it to a batch of
targeted reads... remains future work, not built here" `[SPEC-DF-119]`'s own
words. This is that work: one `remote_peek.py`-style `ssh ... sqlite3 -json`
round trip per change (two for a boundary edit whose anchor span has already
moved once), reconstructed into a disposable SQLite file just large enough
for `tools/apply_changes.py`'s existing merge logic to run against
unmodified -- same three-way merge, same `--emit-sql` capture, same
correctness guarantee, without the whole-file copy in between.

    python tools/apply_changes.py snapshot.db changes.json --commit --emit-sql patch.sql --clear-flags

Deliberately narrow: it answers only what `apply_changes.py`'s own
`resolve_passage()`/`current_recording()`/`current_boundary()`/
`current_artist()`/`history_for()` read for the exact identities named in
`changes.json` -- not a general-purpose remote query tool, and not a partial
replication scheme for anything else.
