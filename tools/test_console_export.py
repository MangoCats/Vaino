"""Tests for the bundle-builder GUI's local-terminal step `[IMPL007 Stage 5]`.

`vaino_control.open_terminal` actually spawning a real terminal window is
exercised live, not here -- there is no headless way to prove a GUI window
opened, and every other console page is verified the same way
`[IMPL003 Stage 2]`. What this checks is the one branch that is
deterministic and side-effect-free: a directory that does not exist is
refused before anything is spawned.
