"""Fetch missing cover art from the Cover Art Archive `[REQ-VIS-170]`.

Measured on this library: 1,986 files carry no embedded picture, and 1,656 of
them (83%) already have a `folder.jpg` beside them -- the player now looks
there and needs nothing from the network. Those folders are asked about
anyway, and deliberately: `folder.jpg` is one image, and the archive also
carries the **back** of the sleeve, which no folder convention provides.

So this asks about every release behind an art-less file -- **484** on this
library, not the 309 whose folders have nothing. One manifest request each
tells the archive's answer exactly, then at most one download per side.

Keyed by **release**, not by folder. A directory can hold more than one album,
which is exactly the case on the DAO rips that make up most of the remaining
gap, and `folder.jpg` cannot tell them apart.

**Front and back both**, because MuLibPlay carried both and showed them side by
side; 559 of its 675 albums had a back. Nothing else: its art totalled 80.5 MB
of a 90.7 MB database, and a third image nobody displays would be that bargain
again.

Sampo's job, not the player's. `[REQ-NEG-100]` forbids *playback* depending on
a live external service; fetching at build time into local storage is the
division that requirement exists to protect. Nothing here runs on the appliance.
