"""Tests for `vaino_control.peer_reachable`/`peer_host` `[SPEC-MESH-090]`.

The online dot on Sampo's node list. Two things are worth pinning and one
thing is worth refusing to pin:

  * `peer_host` must split a `user@host:/path` the way `scp`/`ssh` do --
    on the FIRST colon, because a Windows-side path can contain more, and
    the `user@` part never does. Getting this wrong points the probe at the
    wrong name, which fails open in the most confusing possible way: a green
    dot for a host nobody is talking to.
  * `peer_reachable` must answer, never raise. An unresolvable name, a down
    host and a firewalled port are all simply "not reachable" to a person
    looking at a list, and an exception here would take the whole table down
    with it.

What is deliberately NOT tested is whether any particular real host is up.
This suite binds a listener on loopback and asks about that, so it gives the
same answer on a laptop in a tunnel as it does on the bench. A test that
needed `bose` to be plugged in would fail for reasons that have nothing to
do with this code.
