"""Bring MuLibPlay's lyrics into Vaino `[SPEC-LYR-030]`.

    import_lyrics.py <vaino.db> <mulib.db> [--apply]

**A join, not a matching problem.** Every lyric MuLibPlay holds carries
`mbidRecording`, which is the identity Vaino already transports
`[SPEC-DF-030]` -- so this pairs on a key rather than guessing from titles.
Measured on the live pair: 2,288 lyrics, 2,265 of them (99.0%) naming a
recording Vaino knows.

Importing is Sampo's job and not the player's `[SPEC-LYR-030]`, for the same
reason the player does not write `recordings`: derived reference data has one
writer, and a player that edits it becomes a second source of truth for
something it only reads.

Dry by default. `--apply` writes.
