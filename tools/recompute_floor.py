"""
[LOG-I5-050] Recompute the reproducibility floor on OUR library.

Every "vs floor" ratio reported so far uses constants measured on a generic
AcousticBrainz sample, single-submission versus single-submission. Two things
are wrong with that as a reference for Vaino:

  1. beta -- a characteristic's natural spread -- is a property of the corpus
     being searched. Ours is not the average corpus [SPEC-FD-051].
  2. The floor is single-vs-single, but the dump holds a mean of 77 submissions
     per library recording [GDE-FEX-057]. Averaging those cancels most encoding
     noise, so the honest reference is submission-vs-consensus, which is
     STRICTER. Current ratios are therefore flattering by an unmeasured margin.

This computes both, on the library's own 7,685 multi-submission recordings:

  floor_single  submission 0 vs submission 1        (comparable to the old 0.210)
  floor_mean    one submission vs the N-submission consensus   (the honest one)

Usage:
