"""Build a blind listening test for `[GDE-ECHO-550]`: is a trimmed frame audible?

    tools/trim_audibility.py out.wav [seconds_per_segment] [trim_interval_s] [seed]

Phase 5 corrects a *rate* error by dropping or duplicating one frame on
submission `[GDE-ECHO-340]`. The plan sized that at "roughly one frame per
minute at 0.4 ppm" and was believed inaudible by inspection. At the drift
actually measured the interval is one frame every **1.7 to 5.7 s**
`[LOG-CAL-080]`, and once every 1.7 s is not obviously inaudible. This turns
that from an assumption into an answer, which decides whether Phase 5 can trim
frames or must resample fractionally.

**The signal is the worst case on purpose.** Sustained pure tones, where
removing one sample leaves a phase discontinuity with nothing to mask it. Real
music hides such things behind transients and noise; a sustained chord does
not. So a *negative* result here is strong -- if it cannot be heard on this, it
cannot be heard on music -- while a positive result only means the worst case
is audible, and should be retested on real material before concluding.

**Run it on a node with no codec and no resampler in the path.** `bose`'s I²S
DAC via `aplay -D hw:...` qualifies. `vainopi` does not: SBC is lossy and
PipeWire's adaptive resampler is already inserting and dropping samples of its
own `[LOG-CAL-080]`, so the test would measure their sum.

The order of trimmed and clean segments is chosen by `seed` and printed at the
end. **Do not read it to the listener before they answer.**
