"""Land flags exported from a remote installation `[SPEC006 §10]`.

Reads a `flags.json` from `tools/export_flags.py` and, for each record,
resolves its portable anchor against *this* installation's own library --
a recording directly by its mbid, a passage via `apply_changes.py`'s own
`resolve_passage()`, the identical anchor `[SPEC-DF-103]` already uses for a
boundary edit. What resolves is flagged here exactly as `[REQ-VIS-265]`'s
checkbox would have flagged it locally; what does not is reported, not
silently dropped -- "overlapping" libraries are not identical by
definition, and a flag Sampo's own `/flags` page could not resolve would be
the blank rendering `[REQ-LIB-190]` was built to avoid.

Idempotent: a flag already present here, by the same resolved subject, is
skipped -- re-running this after a second pull is harmless.

Rehearse by default, like every other tool here:

    python tools/import_flags.py <this installation's db> flags.json
    python tools/import_flags.py <this installation's db> flags.json --commit

    directly to the SQLite path and cannot assume any particular Vaino has
    ever opened this file at all. A desktop that has never had a listener
    flag anything locally, and is only ever pulled *into*, is exactly the
    case where the table is missing outright, not merely missing a column
    -- `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` covers that; `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`
    still runs after, to bring an older table (built before `origin` was
    added) up to date, the same two-step `ensure_flags_columns` documents
    on the Rust side.

    Previously this ran only the `ALTER TABLE`, wrapped in a blanket
    `except OperationalError: pass` that silently treated "no such table:
    listener_flags" the same as "already has the column" -- so a pull
    against a library missing the table outright looked like it was
    landing flags right up until the very next `SELECT` against it failed
