"""The Sampo console, read-only half `[SPEC013]`, `[IMPL-SUI-040]`.

Stage 2 of [IMPL003](../docs/IMPL003-sampo-console-build.md): the views. This
file's own connection to the library stays `mode=ro` throughout -- nothing in
it ever executes a `sqlite3` write -- so the safety claim is structural
rather than promised: a console that cannot open the database for writing
cannot damage a library a player is using, whatever route triggers the
request. That is narrower than "no POST route in this file," which was true
once but no longer is: stage 3's job dispatch and `[REQ-VIS-265]`'s unflag
both hang off `do_POST` below. Neither writes *here* -- a job runs the same
CLI a person would run by hand, against its own connection; unflaging
signals the already-running Vaino to write its own listener state over HTTP,
in `vaino_control.py`, never a `listener_flags` write from this process.

That is what makes it runnable against the live database on day one. The
library is WAL `[SPEC-SUI-082]`, so readers never block the player: browsing
seven thousand files here cannot interrupt a note being played there.

Three views:

  /            library -- what is known, and how it came to be known
  /folder      what is on disk, against what the database claims
  /profile/N   one passage's whole derivation

    Split or not `[IMPL-DBSPLIT-025]`: `vaino_db.connect` opens the
    catalogue as `main` -- this console is overwhelmingly a library browser
    -- and attaches the listener half for the history, flag and preference
    views that need it. On an unsplit installation it is the same
    `sqlite3.connect` this always was, with nothing attached.

    `role=ROLE_LIBRARY` is not arbitrary: the catalogue is the half this
    page bootstraps nothing in but reads most of, and putting it in `main`
    means a stray `CREATE` here could only ever shadow a *listener* table,
    which this file never writes. The authorizer refuses that too.

    **One connection per request, never one shared by every thread.** This
    used to return a single connection held in `STATE["db"]`, opened with
    `check_same_thread=False` and used by every handler thread at once.
    `sqlite3` serializes access per connection, so that one handle was a
    convoy: any request blocked inside SQLite held it, and every other
    request -- including ones wanting only the catalogue -- queued behind it
    with no timeout of its own. Observed live 2026-09-11 against a console
    launched from Vaino's browse page, stacks taken with `py-spy`: the accept
    loop healthy in `serve_forever`, two handler threads blocked in
    `conn.execute` on the shared handle, and every later connection
    accumulating in a five-deep listen backlog until new ones were refused
    outright. That refusal is what a co-resident Vaino reads as "no Sampo
    here", so it starts another -- which is how three consoles ended up bound
    to one port.

    The player made the same call the other way and wrote down why
    (`web/mod.rs`: *"A path rather than a connection: `rusqlite`'s is not
    `Sync`, and a request opens its own"*). Sampo was the odd one out.
    Measured at 1.5 ms warm, against requests that were already costing
    more than that, so the convoy bought nothing.

    `check_same_thread` goes back to `sqlite3`'s own `True`: a connection
    opened here is used and closed by the one thread that asked for it, and
    the stricter default now catches a future handler that tries to share
    one again.
