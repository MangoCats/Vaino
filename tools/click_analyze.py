"""Read a recording of `click_emit.py`'s track and report the rate difference.

    tools/click_analyze.py recording.wav [expected_interval_s]

Reports **emitter ppm minus recorder ppm**. An acoustic measurement cannot give
either one alone: it compares two clocks and has no third to appeal to. To make
a figure absolute, measure one side electrically and subtract -- which is the
whole point of running `bose` past a microphone that has already heard
`vainopi` `[GDE-ECHO-570]`.

The arithmetic. Clicks leave the emitter `interval` nominal-seconds apart, so
the real time between them is `interval / (1 + e_emit)`. The recorder counts
that in its own samples and reports `interval * (1 + e_rec) / (1 + e_emit)`. Fit
the reported spacing `a` and:

    e_emit - e_rec  ~=  (1 - a) * 1e6  ppm

**How this is fitted matters more than how the clicks are found.** The first
analysis of the `vainopi` recording reported +12,574 ppm from good data
`[LOG-DRIFT-064]`: it took the rate from the first and last detection, and three
spurious detections set those endpoints. A span estimator hands its entire
answer to its two most fragile points. So this one finds the longest run of
consecutive clicks whose spacing is credible, fits least squares across all of
it, and prints the residual so a bad fit cannot masquerade as a good one.
