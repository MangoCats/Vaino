# Run the player's test suite on every supported target.
#
# Written after an audit found that "cross-compiles cleanly" had been standing
# in for "works": the suite had only ever RUN on Windows, aarch64 was compiled
# but never executed, and Linux x86_64 had never been built at all. Compiling is
# not testing.
#
# It also found a bug that only a real audio device could expose -- the Windows
# device opens at 48 kHz against a 44.1 kHz library, and the resampler was not
# wired into the playback path, so audio ran 8.8% fast. A null sink reports no
# rate, so it hid the fault entirely. Hence [D] below.
#
#   A  Linux x86_64            native in Docker
#   B  Linux aarch64           cross-compiled, executed under emulation
#   C  Windows x86_64          run on the host
#   D  real audio device       manual; a null sink cannot catch rate mismatches
#
# Usage:  sh build/verify-targets.sh
set -u
# Two forms of the same path: POSIX for the shell, native for docker -v.
# Combining them with || in one command substitution ran BOTH branches.

# Run a test suite and report **the suite's** status, never a filter's.
#
# Every stage below used to read, in effect:
#
#     docker run ... cargo test ... | grep -E "^test result: ok\.|FAILED" || fail=...
#
# and the pattern matches the FAILED line, so `grep` exited 0 on a red suite
# and the `||` never fired. Measured 2026-09-18: three failing stages printed
# their own failures in full, and this script then said ALL TARGETS PASS and
# exited 0. Two tests broken on 2026-09-06 sat twelve days behind it. That is
# the house rule -- "do not pipe a command through grep/tail and then read
# `$?`; that is the filter's status, not the command's" -- broken by the
# script written to enforce the discipline.
#
# So the status comes from the command and the grep only chooses what is
# shown. **An empty result is a failure too**: a run that printed no
# `test result:` line at all did not run, and a gate that cannot tell that
# from a pass is the same fault wearing a different hat.
