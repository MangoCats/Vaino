# Merged 2026-09-11 from this script and the older `deploy-vainopi.sh`
# `[GDE-DEP-095]`. They overlapped only in the no-ref case, and the split had
# already begun to cost: the ref-capable half refused a dirty tree while the
# half `deploy-everywhere.sh` actually calls did not, so the FLEET path -- the
# one most likely to run unattended -- carried the weaker guard, and shipped a
# `+dirty` binary to bose on 2026-09-11.
#
# That guard now lives in `build/install-player.sh`, where both entry points
# converge and where it checks the ARTEFACT rather than this checkout's git
# state. The pre-build refusal below is kept too: failing before a 90-second
# cross-compile is worth more than failing after one.
#
# Everything past the build is `build/install-player.sh`, which owns the
# two-layer write an overlay-rooted appliance needs `[IMPL-BOS-185]`.

# Git Bash on Windows "helpfully" rewrites any argument that looks like a
# bare Unix path -- including a container-side path such as `/w` or
# `/build.sh`, which have nothing to do with the host filesystem at all --
# into a Windows path. Inside a `-v` flag this only fires when the host-side
# half is ALSO a bare Unix path (`/tmp/...`); once the host half is already a
# real Windows path (`C:/...`, what `win_path` below produces), the
# container-side half of that flag is left alone. So every mount source in
# this script is put through `win_path` first. A bare container-only path
# used elsewhere on a command line -- e.g. `bash /build.sh` as the container
# command below -- still gets rewritten regardless, since MSYS does not know
# it is not this command's `-v` flag; those spots need `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV`
# scoped to just that one command (`VAR=val cmd`, not exported), since
# exporting it globally would also block the POSIX-style paths *this
# script's own* `git`/`pwd` calls use from becoming ones `git.exe` can open.

# `deploy-vainopi.sh` built appliances WITH this flag and this script built
# them WITHOUT it, so which binary an appliance received depended on which
# command you happened to type. Merging forces one answer; this preserves what
# the fleet runs today rather than changing behaviour inside a merge.
#
# Settled 2026-09-11 in favour of the documented design `[GDE-DEP-098]`:
# appliances build WITHOUT it. `[SPEC-SUI-196]` states the gate exists "so an
# appliance build never resolves or compiles an HTTP client it will never
# call", and `[SPEC-SUI-190]` measured the binary ~200 KB smaller without it.
#
# The deciding argument was not size. On `bose` the catalogue is read-only
# twice over -- `/srv/library` mounted `ro`, and `attach_library()` attaching
# it `mode=ro` by construction -- while `record_review` and `edit_review` both
# write through the catalogue. So `/review` and `/edit` served a page, took
# input, and could not save it: a UI that looks like it works and does not,
# which is worse than a 404.
#
# Set `VAINO_FEATURES="--features sampo-support"` to put it back for a host
# that can actually write its catalogue.
