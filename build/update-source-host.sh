#
# Why this is not another host in deploy-appliance.sh's list: the appliances
# are aarch64 and are sent a cross-compiled binary by build/install-player.sh,
# which refuses outright anything that is not aarch64. A source host is a
# different shape -- its own architecture, its own toolchain, a git checkout,
# and usually no service at all -- so there is nothing to scp and nothing to
# restart. It pulls and rebuilds.
#
# Verification asks the BUILT BINARY what commit it is, not a running player.
# That is deliberate, and it is a stronger check than the appliances get: a
# source host normally has nothing running, and a process that happened to be
# serving the right sha would not prove the binary on disk had been rebuilt.
#
# The host pulls from the git remote, NOT from this machine, so a commit that
# has not been pushed cannot reach it. This refuses up front rather than
# reporting success for having redeployed yesterday's code -- the failure that
# a "deploy" which quietly does nothing is worst at hiding.
