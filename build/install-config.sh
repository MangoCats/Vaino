# This exists because `scp` and `install` do NOT do that on an overlay-rooted
# appliance, and say nothing about it `[IMPL-BOS-185]`. On `bose`, `/` is an
# overlay whose upper layer is tmpfs: an ordinary write succeeds, is readable,
# survives a service restart, passes every check anyone thought to run -- and
# is gone at the next power cycle. Five days of player deploys went that way,
# and so did the unit file that knew the database had been split, which is the
# one that actually stopped the music.
#
# So the rule `[GDE-DEP-070]`: write BOTH layers, and verify the DURABLE one.
# The live copy is what runs now; the copy on the lower filesystem is what runs
# after a reboot, and only the second is evidence of anything.
#
# `[GDE-DEP-060]`: it says which kind of target it thinks it has before acting.
# A script that silently assumes produces a log indistinguishable from one that
# assumed correctly.
#
# Non-overlay hosts (vainopi, and any ordinary machine) take the plain path and
# are told so -- the detection is on the target's actual mount, never on its
# name, which is the mistake this whole family of scripts is recovering from.
